I told her several times over the course of a week that I am not available to babysit. She dropped the baby on my porch and her and my mom drove away saying that I will have to deal with it and cancel my plans.  I called the cops for child abandonment. 

I have hemmoraged my resources into my parents and sister for years and I am drawing a hard line. I am not getting involved with a baby, it was her choice to have this kid and I am not going to support her choices.  She is 24 and has never had a full time job.

158,This is why I'm not a fan of Chappell anymore... üíî,"
I saw Chappell Roan at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.

She said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but she kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.

The boy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúMa'am, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When he took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly.",/r/chappellroan/comments/1frkwbq/this_is_why_im_not_a_fan_of_chappell_anymore/

190,UPDATE- WIBTAH if I called CPS on my wife‚Äôs sister for her child?,"I posted my original post a few days ago and a few people asked for an update out of concern for the kid. I called CPS shortly after posting that. They sent a well check over pretty quickly after what I described. A social worker was involved. She apparently was really good, knew the right questions to ask, and the kid admitted to her what had been happening. Unfortunately, I was correct, and she told the social worker it was her dad. Her mother knew. Her mother allowed it. 

They were arrested. The kid was taken in for a while but now she is with us. My wife is completely upset and distraught that her sister was allowing that to happen to her own child, and that the kid has been suffering for at least 6 months. My wife is not mad that I called, she is grateful. She admitted to being blind to the situation and she is very upset with herself because of it. My wife can be a bit naive sometimes, she assumed the best in her sister, she is not a bad person.

As for the kid, she is safe with us and doing okay. She always told my wife she wanted to live here so she is happy for now. Just in the past few days she has gotten a bit warmed up to me. I am hoping she is going to be okay. She asked me to hold that stuffed cat yesterday, so that's something, I think. We are working with a lot of professionals for her. Thanks for the response the first time around. Although I am sure we all hoped for an update that I was wrong, at least she is safe now.

I‚Äôve been maintaining intermittent fasting since the end of 2021 and my weight has stayed consistently between 136-145 lbs for the last two years. 

I focused on my eating habits for a year and then started to layer in walking and then got up to running over the last year and I feel like I‚Äôve really become ‚Äúfit‚Äù for the first time in my adult life!

It appears that my suspicions are true, and that I am being specifically targeted by Nintendo.   My recent Wii U video was taken down and I received a second copyright strike, even though this showcase video was no different than all of the tech demos and reviews I have made on this channel previously.  I am still considering a counter claim under fair use, as the video was for educational use, transformative in nature, and had no affect on the market -- it was a demonstration of a console no longer for sale (even the Wii U eShop is closed, so the company itself has no means of earning revenue from Wii U sales).  However, I am reluctant to open that can of worms with a multi-billion dollar corporation, as their next step would be to file legal action.  
  
At the very least this means I am going to change how I approach future videos.  I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen, which is a shame because I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations.  I don't know how that will play out when it comes to showing things like ESDE frontend themes that contain Nintendo characters, but for now I am going to focus on actual gameplay.  I am also going through the videos I am working on and blurring out any Nintendo game content as a precaution, even innocuous content like NES games.  Unfortunately this is going to delay some video releases -- my latest video should be up right now, but instead I have to re-edit and re-upload the video first.  
  
I know this is disappointing news, but with now two strikes on my channel, I don't really have any other choice except to adjust accordingly.  Thanks for your understanding.

Look, if you've already maxed out your char near 620 ilvl, that's not M+s fault.

We praised the game for giving a lot of ways to gear. And if you already are near 620 without Mythic Raiding, it's very clear right?

The game has one, respected your time. And two, it's time for you to decide if you'll Mythic Raid, the only non-Great Vault obvious upgrades you might get.

Everything building up to that decision to either mythic raid, or play alts (alt friendly expansion btw) or take a break.

370,Illegal short sellers will now face life sentence in prison after the National Assembly approved the amendment,"[Article](https://franknez.com/illegal-short-sellers-will-now-face-life-sentence-in-prison/)

Text:

Illegal short sellers will now face life sentence in prison after the National Assembly approved the amendment.

The National Assembly has approved an amendment to the Capital Markets Act aimed at enhancing penalties for illegal short selling, per Business Korea.

Under this new law, individuals who profit illegally from short selling exceeding 5 billion won (around $3.79 million) could face severe penalties, including prison sentences of up to life imprisonment.

On September 27, financial authorities confirmed that the amendment, designed to overhaul the short selling system, passed the National Assembly on September 26.

The legislation mandates that institutional investors must establish an electronic short selling system, and both institutional and corporate investors are now required to implement internal control standards.

Approximately 101 companies, representing 92% of domestic short selling transactions, must adopt these electronic systems.

These firms will also be obligated to report stock balances and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to the exchange, increasing their compliance responsibilities under the newly instituted central monitoring system.

Securities firms will need to annually verify the internal controls and electronic systems of institutional and corporate investors, following a checklist, and report the findings to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).

Non-compliance could result in fines of up to 100 million won.

To standardize short selling conditions for individual and institutional investors, the repayment period for loan transactions related to short selling will also be constrained.

Violations of this rule will incur fines of up to 100 million won, with loan terms extendable in 90-day increments for a maximum of 12 months.

Additionally, the amendment seeks to deter repeated illegal short selling by increasing administrative penalties.

Fines for unfair trading and illegal short selling will rise from three to five times the illicit profit to four to six times.

Offenders earning over 5 billion won from illegal short selling may now face the same enhanced prison terms as those engaging in unfair trading.

Administrative sanctions will be broadened, allowing regulators to restrict trading of financial investment products for up to five years and limit the appointment or reappointment of executives at listed companies.

This aims to tackle the high recidivism rate among financial criminals by effectively barring them from the market for a specified duration.

To combat the concealment of illegal profits, accounts suspected of being involved in unfair trading or illegal short selling can be frozen for up to six months, with a possible extension of an additional six months.

The amended law will take effect on March 31 of next year, providing time for the implementation of the electronic short selling system, which is expected to be operational by then.

However, restrictions on trading financial products and executive appointments will begin six months after the law is enacted, following public consultations.

Upcoming revisions to the enforcement decree will lower the short selling disclosure threshold from 0.5% to 0.01% of outstanding shares and reduce the collateral ratio for individual short sellers to match that of institutional investors, with completion expected by next month.

A representative from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) noted that limiting the loan repayment period for short selling transactions to 12 months, along with finalizing amendments to the Financial Investment Business Regulations, will lower the collateral ratio for individual short sellers from 120% to 105%, leveling the playing field.

The FSC official added, ‚ÄúWith the electronic short selling system set to launch in March, the improvements to the short selling framework will be fully realized.

Our goal is to restore investor confidence and enhance the competitiveness of the South Korean stock market.‚Äù",/r/Superstonk/comments/1frjiuz/illegal_short_sellers_will_now_face_life_sentence/

386,"Despite being 18 and having a fifth grade reading level, I managed to finish reading my first book.","Earlier I talked about the fact that I've never read books in my life, which has made me functionally illiterate, unable to read complicated texts and understand and interpret them.

I had already tried to read a book called ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" but I only managed to read three chapters because it was  difficult.

But now I've managed to read a book I had at home about a boy who looks after his grandmother, by a writer called Roald Dal.

The book I have is in English and not in Portuguese or Spanish (my languages) but it's the simplest one I have.

It was really difficult to read and understand the story because my brain doesn't work well and because I've never read before.

413,1 Ferrero Rocher will cost 1 job and millions ,"I worked for this asshole of an owner - the guy is a narcissistic has been jock, but otherwise I worked with some of the most amazing people so I actually enjoyed going to work.  I worked hard and took our biggest account out from probation due to poor performance to being a preferred vendor and awarded all new projects - I made this guy so much money. 

He decided to hire his braindead girlfriend and she was to take some of my accounts and a 1/3 of the other PM's. Of course she couldn't hack the work and he created a bs useless position for her. In turn he dumped everything on me - my original accounts plus the 1/3 of the other PM because she's kinda useless too - I was already up to my eyeballs with work before this. 

At the same time he decided to hire his idiot buddy from across the country to be my boss. He relocated to our office and soon I found out he couldn't even form a coherent much less a professional email (this was a highly technical job). So now I was pretty much doing his work too. 

I asked for a raise for the increased workload and was of course denied. I was visibly unhappy and everyone at the small company could see it. You can feel it in the air when you were around me. So he decided to call me into a meeting.  I thought it would be about helping me address the issues or a raise finally. Nope, this asshole told me to act right or I'm free to leave anytime. 

Right after the meeting, I started firing off resumes and it wasn't hard to get offers elsewhere.   I accepted a role 2 weeks later and in that time, him, his buddy and squeeze were acting all smug around me thinking they put me in my place. I sent my resignation and it was shocked pikachu all around. They acted all was good, but I saw their fear.  Buddy is now demoted to my role and I was kind enough to put in 2 weeks to train him. Being an exjock he couldn't let this guy beneath him who demoted him train and learn under me. Reminder this is highly technical role and there were a lot of information, project status etc to learn/pass on. For the first week he didn't bother learning anything, but I told him I was making notes and guides as we go and will pass it on before I leave.

Now, I had this piece of Ferrero Rocher I had sitting on my desk that was given to me on the first day - I just for some reason never ate it. Over time I built this shrine around it and everyone turned it into some inside joke. There's prob worms growing in it by this time and everyone thought it was an exit reward for myself. 

I come in the second week and it was gone. Wrapper in my bin. Owner and buddy walks in all smug and making jokes someone ate my precious chocolate - getting their last laugh. Right then and there I packed my shit, went to HR and told him I changed my last day to today and walked out. No notes/guides, finish training/handover, nothing. 

Buddy tried calling me a week later panicking asking me questions and I told him to get fucked. I found out he majorly screwed the job, got fired and sent home. Owner tried to hire 2 people to do my job, but not knowing anything, all the accounts became a mess. He would flip his shit in meetings. I also found out we were put back on probation with the largest account and eventually lost it along with other key accounts.

461,"Customer asks why I would choose to ""scar myself"" with a tattoo. I told him why.","Hi there everyone, I was browsing this sub when I found a story similar to one of my favorite memories of petty revenge, so I decided to share.

For context, I grew up alongside this girl back when we were just babies, she was six months younger than me. Her dad was a deadbeat at the time and her mom had to work to keep a roof over their heads, so my mom wound up babysitting her frequently, which lead to us growing up like sisters, even if we weren't related at all.

Right after I turned 18 though, she was killed in a car accident. She hadn't hit 18 yet. Two days later, I went and got a tattoo to honor her memory, so I can carry her with me wherever. It's not a noticeable memorial tattoo--her name isn't very huge and there's no dates or anything, so people frequently ask about it and I frequently have to tell people what it's for and tell them the story. This is nbd, I actually like talking about tattoos so it's a good conversation starter.

Cue the uno reverse trauma. I worked in a grocery store where the customers would actually be on the same side of the till as the employees, so there was no hiding behind a big machine or divider. And one day, one of our regulars (who I kind of liked actually) looked over and saw my tattoo. He asked me, in all seriousness, ""why would you choose to scar yourself with that?"" (Those were his exact words).

I just looked over at him, dead in the eyes, totally flat tone, and said, ""my little sister died.""

The backpedalling he did was so hard I thought he'd pedal himself right out of the store. He apologized, but then made the mistake of asking me what happened.

I got to gleefully (in a very monotone voice) tell him all the gory details about how the accident crushed her head and did so much brain damage that even though the rest of her was fine, they still had to take her off life support because there was no chance she'd ever recover, and she never even got to see her high school graduation.

It‚Äôs all porn. All of it. I cannot scroll through any art related sub without coming across untagged soft porn pics. Worst part of it? The fuckers making it aren‚Äôt even brace enough to call it porn; it‚Äôs always ‚Äòpracticing female anatomy‚Äô ‚Äògirls doing x‚Äô or some other title related to the background instead of the main image. Second worst part? Most of these girls look underage. Half of them look like you forced a molested 12 yo in a swimsuit. The not underage ones have extremely exaggerated proportions and expressions. Third worst part? Actual nude studies and sketches that aren‚Äôt made to cater to the creeps lurking in those subs get basically no attention. Nude sketches even get flagged or labeled as porn when they are not.

I‚Äôm tired of it. There‚Äôs no respect for the female body in these pieces, just freaks getting a chance to play out their hentai bs fantasies. Art was like, the one occasion where having someone stand naked in front of you wasn‚Äôt a sexual thing. Maybe I should start drawing those juiced up ‚Äòideals of male beauty‚Äô with overexaggerated junks so they can see how iffy it feels.

506,Luffys final dream ,"Luffys final dream has become on of the biggest mysteries in the series. It‚Äòs quite captivating and unusual that so far into the series, we still don‚Äòt know what the main goal of the protagonist is.

But i don‚Äôt think its that deep tho. It‚Äòs neither going to the moon or throwing a big party. I think what he wants to do is to become friends with the whole world. Just think about it, it‚Äòs something so stupid and childish that people would feel embarrassed to even say something like that. Ace immediately told Yamato not to laugh about it or he would kick her ass. No wonder Oden and Whitebeard were flabbergasted when they heard someone as strong as powerful as Roger say that.

Here is why i think this is the end of his dream: Luffy is stupid and simple. His dream is not something that he would have put much thought into. It has to do something with his immediate urges and wishes. And what are the only things Luffy cares and thinks about? Eating meat and making friends. It could be a huge banquet what he wants, but i dont think everyone else would be so stunned to hear that, since its not even that unrealistic. but being friend to the whole world? Thats something you cannot even image. How would that be possible? Vegapunk talked about how the final war will be about ideologies. While the WGs ideology is made clear: Selfishness, Luffys ideology is based on friendship. Thats his strength and thats how he accumulates power (as mihawk said in marineford). So he will conquer the world by becoming its friend. The whole planet will follow his will not because he will assert violence or social order, but by making everyone try to help him out of a feeling of friendship ",/r/OnePiece/comments/1frka52/luffys_final_dream/

513,I found out my husband has been making life decision based on his ex's suicide note.,"Background on my husband (34m) - He was a fat lonely kid, often bullied, no friends. Then he met Maya, his first and only friend. Like my husband, Maya was also a misfit, came from a dysfunctional family, they became bestfs.

When they were 15, Maya was gang r*ped by her step sister's boyfriend and classmates. She was badly injured, was in coma for 2 weeks.

The r*pists, as they were minor weren't jailed I believe, they got out with minor punishments .(This is the story I have heard from my husband and in laws)

Maya committed suicide right after she woke up, and wrote only one letter of goodbye which was addressed to my husband.

I had never read this letter as I wanted to preserve his privacy and it always felt too personal.

Onto my story - I have been noticing weird things about my husband for a while.

1) We had out first baby when we were 27, I wanted to wait a little before our second but my husband wanted one when he turned 30. He would mumble things like, it has to be 30, it should be at 30.

2) At 30, I had my 2nd kid, a girl,  named her Maya, now I often find him hugging her and crying, asking an infant if he is doing a good job at being a father.

3) We have to go on yearly vacations, even when our kids were babies and we were busy he forced us on a vacy.

4) now that he is turning 35, he insist we buy a bigger house, again keeps mumbling 'the house is at 35.'

Well I read the letter.
It was laminated and filed. He keeps it in the safe along with other imp docs such as house property...

It was a very sweet letter, basically thanked him for being there for her, and then she concluded it with wishing he lives this ""perfect life""

Life where he graduates at 24, marries at 26, has babies at 27 and 30, moves to a big house at 35, always goes on fancy vacy...
End with him being 90 reading stories to his grandkids.

She also tells him to be a good father and husband, if he ever gets tired she wants him to think for her suffering bcuz of her family.


Now that I have read everything, and know that my husband has been planning his entire life based on that letter, it feels soo weird.

I had already tried to read a book called ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" but I only managed to read three chapters because it was  difficult.

But now I've managed to read a book I had at home about a boy who looks after his grandmother, by a writer called Roald Dal.

The book I have is in English and not in Portuguese or Spanish (my languages) but it's the simplest one I have.

It was really difficult to read and understand the story because my brain doesn't work well and because I've never read before.

Understanding and imagining the story, getting to the end without giving up, a few words (but as I said, English is not my language).

Another thing I liked about the book was that it had nice illustrations which helped a lot, unfortunately books for adults my age don't have them :(

I kinda wish they are paired up in interview circuits though - must be interesting to hear their exchanges as I know both of them really have deep knowledge of Tolkien‚Äôs works.

UPDATE! Red is SAFE and in a forever home! He no longer will be living on the streets. No longer will go to sleep hungry, have to worry where his next meal will come from, where a safe place to rest his head will be, protecting himself from predators and cruel people... he's safe. And he's the happiest I've ever seen him in the entire 2 months he was living in my mobile home park. He always walked around with a an exhausted and despaired look on his face, and who could blame him? He doesn't have to worry about any of that now. He found his people, he found HIS home. So many people rooted for him, and those positive thoughts and wishes worked in his favor. Red truly deserved this amazing outcome. ü•π

I want to thank everyone for caring so much about this sweet boy and for being so patient regarding my responses to know if it all ended well. It definitely did. He lucked out with the perfect home, and it truly couldn't have been a better match. Between networking to find Red an adopter/or foster, coordinating transport, communicating with the amazing TNR caretaker who offered to board him for a week while I figured out a plan, and caring for a TNR'd feral for a week + a one-eyed cat for 5 days who was just picked up by the rescue this morning and is being transported 6 hours to his foster home... plus caring for 5 of my own... it's been a bit chaotic! But it paid off and my heart is full and happy, as I'm sure so many people will feel the same way once they see this video of him in his new home.

This is why rescue is so important, as well as spaying and neutering. To promise that each cat, especially the ones dumped/abandoned, find their forever home and can leave a lasting imprint on so many lives. Please consider adopting from your local county shelter or fostering a cat from your nearest rescue, and don't forget to spay and neuter your pets. If you can no longer keep an animal due to personal circumstances, reach out for help. It's out there, I promise. Don't dump them and leave them to survive on their own, because chances are they won't make it very long. Together we can make a world of a difference for so many.

Love you, Red. May you enjoy your new home, you sweet beautiful orange boy!

Sara suffered so much hate that Ryan responded through a magazine, condemning the character's fans and mockingly saying that no one understood Daemon more than him and GRRM.

At that time most people supported Ryan, including this sub. But looking back, i think Daemon fans saw something that many of us didn't.

So many people reached out offering to adopt Red, though just as many failed to call back or show up when it came down to picking him up (PLEASE don't do this!!! It wastes our time and resources that could be used to actually find legitimate placement). There was a bit of panic that he was going to end up with a rescue I didn't jive with - who at the time were the only ones committing to him - but after further questioning it was discovered the rescue was ran only by a husband/wife in their 60's and had a little over 55 cats. Absolutely no disrespect to the rescue as they likely mean well and their intentions are good - but my gut said NO as far as Red going there. I didn't want him to be overlooked in an environment with so many cats, as he deserved one on one love and care... and now thanks to the person who reached out and wanted to help, he'll get just that and more for the rest of his days.

4 years of hell.

That's been my marriage.

The cliche ""fuck I'm pregnant"" knot tie.

We fight daily, the bedroom is all but dead (1 time every 6-8 weeks). And no he's not cheating, that would require effort or leaving the house outside of his 8 hours 5 days a week.

He's forgotten all 4 anniversaries and and is a Meh father.

And marriage counseling just turned into him and his choice of counselors discussing his ADHD.

He never wants to talk about our marriage, there's zero romance.

With 2 kids forcing a divorce would be ridiculously expensive and he won't agree to a one. He claims he still loves me.

The house is in both our names.

I just feel Ike I'm trapped to care for a grown child my entire life.

I just wanted to tell someone I'm miserable.

I don't even hate him, I just want nothing to to do with him anymore.

There's zero attraction, hell, I don't even wear a ring.

*Your poor kids.*

&gt;OOP: I don't let it affect them. I plan family outtings I give them 200% mommy time.

**swine09**

*You‚Äôre lying to yourself if you think they aren‚Äôt affected. Jesus. Kids know when their parents are unhappy or fighting.*

&gt;OOP: They're 4 and 2. They just know that mommy and daddy love them. I hope atleast.

**Finding a divorce attorney was easier than finding a counselor. - 1 days later**

&amp;#x200B;

I laid out my cards on the table today and realized I'd already wasted 10 years of my life.

I turned 25 last Friday.

4 years of marriage, 10 years of dating.

We tried the first counselor he found on Google.

2.8 stars - 80 year old man that specializes in childhood disorders. I shit you not - even that got zero effort from him.

And it was my last straw.

My birthday was a bust. The kids screamed the entire dinner. He patted himself on the back for the first birthday gift he'd even gotten me (not joking 10 years 1 gift). I ended up leaving before they sang the birthday song. Happy fucking birthday to me. He didn't even plan the day, just the same restaurant as our date nights for last 2 years.

Today I figured I'd call to find a better counselor, at the very least to prepare him for the divorce.

10+ places, 2 answered, 1 wanted me to jump through hoops (3 separate sessions each 2 weeks apart, then marriage counseling) and the other was booked until late October.

I spent the day stewing - enraged by the state of my marriage the fact that he couldn't even handle the marriage counseling for the marriage he ruined and the years of my life he'd wasted.

And then I called 1 divorce attorney.

Her office answered after 2 rings and booked me for the consult after 30 minutes of questions. That's all 30 minutes and I have an appointment for tomorrow to start the paperwork.

Haven't had sex that lasted more than a 1 minute in 6 months. 2, 1 minute sessions in 6 fucking months.

I'm smart, I'm beautiful and I'm young. I gave this man 2 children.

He never proposed, just agreed after I got pregnant at 20 that it was probably time. Never asked me to take his name and forgot all 4 anniversaries.

I'm taking back my life now. Single mom in grad school life will be hard for the year I have left, but I'd rather be alone than with him.

I'm done being married to a forgetful, aggressive lazy over grown child. I resent him with every fiber of my being.

Thanks for reading my rant.

It's time to stew quietly while hating my life for now.

*My 93 year old grandmother just left her husband of almost 50 years. She feels like she wasted her life, but she‚Äôs really happy right now. Don‚Äôt waste your one life.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Update: He hit me. - 3 days later**

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a day. And not a good one.

I asked him yesterday to fill out the paperwork for the family counselor I'd found and he wouldn't.

He confronted me about the divorce attorney I'd contacted and I told the truth.

He accused me of cheating - I am not.

Enter from right field angry sex followed by shock that that didn't fix the fucked marriage.

Cue a massive argument and him sleeping in the kids room.

This morning I got the kids fed and started doing laundry.

He made a comment about my ""laziness"" while I was cleaning and I shouted back and walked out of the house.

He locked all doors and wouldn't let me back in. But I had my car keys. So I tried to leave.

And he ran out of the house, snatched my keys and told me I couldn't leave and that he just wanted to leave me outside to bang on the door.

Things escalated and he broke my phone across my face.

I picked up my broken phone and snatched my keys back and when a tussle started I ended up being punched in the face a few times, the ribs a few more and long story short...

I now look like I went a few rounds with Tyson. Our kids saw this.

He ran off threatening to harm himself. I called his psy and his father.

And I'm just... numb.

My body and face hurt. I think my thumb is broken. And now my family has been dragged in to my fucked marriage. My damn near brand new phone is broken.

So void... how's that for a shit day? I get to go to school Monday looking like a failed MMA fighter.

(I want to note with a bitter sense of fucked up humor, fucker took no clothing when he left.. but he did stop to grab his PS5)

**Crabman009-**

*Oh my God. I hope you are okay. Did you call the police? What did his dad say?*

&gt;OOP: I did. His father blamed me for ""being stupid and putting him under too much stress"".

**RO489**

*And that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs never going to change. He‚Äôs never learned to do better and is being reinforced it‚Äôs not his fault.*

*Make sure this is on the record and don‚Äôt let him back in the house. Can you get a restraining order? Or have a as make relative stay with you?*

&gt;OOP: His father isn't much different. His mother left with protection order to get away from him. I'm not at all shocked by his response.

I‚Äôve been playing Warframe for a while now (9 year's) and recently managed to break three world records! I was so hyped, but that excitement quickly faded because I got hit with a ban out of nowhere.

I reached out to support, hoping to clear things up, but they hit me with the generic ‚Äúthird-party software‚Äù response. Problem is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never used any third-party programs. Ever.

I‚Äôm genuinely confused and frustrated. If this was triggered by something I did in-game while pushing the limits for those world records, I want to know. But without any real clarification, I feel stuck.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is there anything I can do to get my account back?
I‚Äôve invested so much time into this game, and I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished. It sucks to have it taken away without a clear reason.

Any help, advice, or insight would be appreciated. If this post gets enough attention, maybe the devs will take a closer look.",/r/Warframe/comments/1froi0l/i_got_banned_for_breaking_3_world_records_in/

722,Am I the asshole for letting my daughter say ‚Äúno‚Äù to a boy who asked her to homecoming??,"My daughter is a freshman in high school and she was really looking forward to this first homecoming dance. She is a cheerleader and was at an away football game and one of the boys on the football team made a sign and decorated a football and asked her to the dance. The boys parents were there recording and were repeatedly asking her ‚Äúwhat do you say Jerzi‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your answer‚Äù she was saying things like ‚Äúthank you so much‚Äù and ‚Äúthis was so nice‚Äù but the questions continued and she eventually just said ‚Äúok‚Äù. For a little backstory about my daughter she struggles with anxiety, and has a hard time in social situations like this. Her dad was an alcoholic and died 2 years ago, which has really changed the way she had to grow up!! I moved me and my kids back home a couple months ago and we live in a very small town, so I had a video of the interaction sent to me before Jerzi was even on the bus to come home. My daughter and I are very close, so I knew that she was absolutely dying on the inside, I could see it all over her face. When she got home she was telling me all about it, and come to find out she has never even spoken to the boy who asked her to the dance. She kept saying she just wants to go with her friends or see if someone else asks her, but she didn‚Äôt want to hurt the boys feelings. I told her it was ok to say no to him if she didn‚Äôt want to go with him. Some of her friends were telling her to just go with him, there will be other dances, some of them were telling her to say no‚Ä¶but someone said to her ‚ÄúI would say yes to whoever asked me, cuz I was raised better than that‚Äù‚Ä¶ which, yes that is exactly the way I was raised, but I don‚Äôt want my daughter to feel like she has to say yes to a boy  just because that‚Äôs what he wants‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs allowed to have a say too!!! So while I do feel bad for the boy that asked her, I also feel like it‚Äôs ok to say no‚Ä¶does that make me an asshole?!?

EDITED TO ADD/ UPDATE

OK, so I‚Äôm just following up a little bit first of all thank you guys for all the comments I really do appreciate it and feel supported!!! During the whole situation, I had multiple parents reach out to me, some of them being family, and telling me they wouldn‚Äôt let her go with him, that his family is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. I have forever told my kids they can ALWAYS use me as an out for anything!! I will always take the heat!! I still know a lot of people around here, but I have no idea who these people are. To make things even worse‚Ä¶The mom went home and posted the video on Facebook (I had it sent to me)saying that her baby boy had finally asked someone to a dance and they said yes‚Ä¶and you can clearly see her in the video very uncomfortably say ‚Äúok‚Äù!! The day after she had sent him a very nice message explaining how she didn‚Äôt want to go with him for her first homecoming, how it would be awkward since they have never even spoke and she just wants to go with friends, etc. the boy has sent the message to several people and the message she sent has been going around her school, with people either agreeing with what she said, or saying she was to nice, or even to mean. Which led me to tell her this is a prime example of you can never please everybody!! This whole situation has been a lot for her and he keeps trying to text her like excessively which resulted in her just unadding him as she is very tired of all of this. I‚Äôm about to the point of reaching out to the parents!!",/r/dustythunder/comments/1frekkk/am_i_the_asshole_for_letting_my_daughter_say_no/

729,Bye bye Netherlands,"Hi. After 4 years I'm finally leaving the Netherlands and I feel so happy for first time after so long. I'll try to explain my experience here and give my view on several Dutch aspects. Comments of any kind are welcome, including ""go to your fucking country"" or ""NL is gonna be a better place without you"". Please don't take this too serious!

I am a 32 y/o structural engineer who came in 2020 to work in the Amsterdam area. I like my job and company, colleagues are great and the salary is great under the 30 % ruling. I was also very excited about living in a city like Amsterdam but in less than a year I started struggling with my daily life here. I've lived in several countries around EU, one in S.America and another one in Asia so I'm quite used to cultural changes and adapting to new  landscapes, but for me NL was a different story. I name a few aspects (positive and negative)

**The system**: First of all I have to admit the country is very well arranged. Coming from a Southern country I found it so easy to settle down in the NL. Communicating with authorities and arranging everything was very easy and straightforward. I also found the civil servants nice and helpful. 

I was also amazed about the canals, delta works and all the infrastructure to keep the water out. Really well done dutchies!

**Cycling culture**: This is the think I've enjoyed more. The freedom to cycle anywhere is amazing. The cycling lines infrastructure is amazing. No need to have a car here, at least for me, which was great.

**The weather**: I kinda like the cold and I've lived in colder countries but the weather here is the worst I've experienced. Rainy and windy always. Even when the sun shines a cold breeze fucks everything up. In the summer week(s) it can be warm but then it is so humid that it makes it very uncomfortable.   
I guess this is one of the disadvantages of living in such a flat country inside the sea.

**The food**: No culinary love or culture whatsoever. Food is like the country itself, plane and grey. A Dutch colleague explained that this is part of the protestant heritage, where enjoyment should be kept to a minimum. For me cuisine is religion and sharing a table with a massive amount of nice food and drinks with family and friends is routine.

**Job market**: This is the biggest pro I found. Salaries are high, specially if you fall under the ruling. Work culture is very chill and workers feel relaxed because of the labor shortage. If you want to make your career and get promoted quickly this is the ideal place.

**Multiculturality**: I love to meet people from all around the world. In the NL if found people from all backgrounds, both at work and outside. I find this very enrichening for myself. Also for the country I think it is great, bringing knowledge and different point of views for the industries seems like a clever move.

**Dutch people / society**: This is for me the biggest disappointment by far.   
When I came to NL I had an image of a progressive society with a bit of underground vibe but soon I realized exactly the opposite. The *doe het normaal* attitude dictates the average Dutch mentality.   
I was shocked when I realized all the people acting the same way, dressing the same way, expecting the same things. It looks like all the dutchies have the same firmware installed in their brain. 

-The minimum courtesy or etiquette norms are inexistent. Allowing getting out before getting in, holding the door for the next one, saying hello or thank you are normal things a child learns since day one in my country, and the majority I've visited. Not in the NL. Here I am still amazed when I see a man bumping into the train before people can get out not giving a shit, but even worst, it seems normal for all the rest. Or a woman clipping her nails while walking in a store or just no one allowing a pregnant woman take a sit. For me all these are signs of a sick society. 

-Hygiene. It is well known the dutch love for not washing after the WC, but I've seen much worst things. People cycling for one hour in normal clothes and getting to the office sweating. Everyday. People clipping their nails in a meeting room. People picking from their nose in the office, or train, like normal. Not to comment all kind of nasal noises that seems normal here. People walking in the gym barefoot, dripping sweat, using the machines without a towel and of course not cleaning after. Not one or two, a lot of people.

-Noise: It seems pretty normal for dutch people to speak loud or make a wide variety of noises with their mouth even in the office. I hate it.

-Stingies: Dutchies have also the stigma of being cheap. First time I was invited to a bbq and was told ""bring your own food"" I was shocked. Of course I was gonna bring food and drinks to share. When I was there I had a lot of food ready to share and dutchies were there with their own sausage, feeling strange because I made food and put it in common.  
Another day in a pub we got different beers in group. After trying a bit a dutch guy said ""I don't like my beer too much"" so I offered to give him my Guiness (which I love) and take his beer because I can drink anything. He refused because his beer was more expensive. You serious?

-And my favorite: Dutch directness. A friend of mine said ""they have snake tongue and princess ears"" and I cannot agree more. Dutchies feel good being direct but they get soon offended and defensive if you go to the same level or counterargue. To me it is just arrogance and lack of empathy. Even if you probe them wrong they will refuse to accept it, even if they know it. My theory about ""ducth directness"" is that they don't understand body language. Somebody picking from his nose and you give him a piercing look and it seems they don't understand what you mean. They need to be told ""stop doing that""

-Hypocrisy: Many times I've seen a Dutch person complaining about something and telling somebody off...while they do the same or worst things!   
A lady with a dog told off a friend for throwing a butt to the floor while her dog was shitting in the floor and she did not pick up. My friend picked up the butt and told the lady to clean her dog's. She just walked away saying ""that is natural"". No sign of shame.   
Or a neighbor complaining to other neighbor for parking his camper in front of the house common door... and after park his own camper in the same place. Again, no signs of shame at all.  
Or the ""soft drug tolerance"" policy. Ok, so you allow selling of over-the-counter soft drugs (and tax them) but then for the coffee shops it is illegal to provide for themselves and they have to go to the black market. Anyone can explain if this makes sense? Hypocrisy.  
Again I could name a long list here.

**-Housing**: This is the biggest problem here. I've known some dramatic stories. I was very lucky with my rented flat but I had to reject some job offers that required relocating because I was not feeling like going through the same torture of getting a house again. I know this is a problem all along the EU (and more) but in the NL the housing crisis is ridiculous since many years ago. And what has the government done regarding this in the last 20 years? What will they do? Shut up and keep paying taxes!

**-Healthcare**: This is directly a joke, a scam. So you pay a monthly a premium and then you barely have access to a GP that will ignore you most of the times. Prevention? what is that? A yearly check or cancer screening plan? not here, maybe that's why there is one of the highest cancer rates.   
Are you pregnant and close to give birth? You will do it at home unless you want to pay for the hospital and anesthesia, and even then they will try you to do it at home. Are we animals giving birth in a barn or what?   
The overpriced  blood test you paid from your pocket shows you have anemia and cholesterol, but the GP prescribes nothing. For the anemia ""eat more meat"" and for the cholesterol ""eat less meat"". Solved. True story.   
  
The majority of foreigners that I know go back to their home countries when they need medical attention. This is a sign that things are not right here.

**-Services**: Bad service. Lack of professionalism. Ridiculous prices.   
From having a beer in a bar to hire a plumber all I found is bad and expensive service. The lack of attention to the detail or lack of sense of ownership is disgusting.   
The waiter brings you a beer with 50% foam or not properly filled or serves the food in a dirty table and they don't care.   
A mechanic makes a mistake and leaves you weeks without car and they don't feel ashamed enough to quickly fix it, you will wait until he has availability again because he just does not care!   
The customer orientation does not exist here, all that a provider sees when you need a service is a opportunity to get your money. Good luck when you are in need or in a rush, they will smell the blood.

**-Public transport**: It is kinda hypocrite encouraging people to use less private transport and be greener in general and then you put those ridiculous prices in public transport that makes it easier and cheaper to use your own car. In my case these cost are covered by my employer but this is not right.

With all this I'm so happy to say BYE BYE NETHERLANDS!! I hope to see you never again.  
Good luck to everyone staying here, I wish you all the best. Please don't take this post to seriously, this is just my totally subjective point of view. There are a lot of people doing really well in the country and feeling happy so they all cannot be wrong instead of me!",/r/Netherlands/comments/1fr9yyf/bye_bye_netherlands/

755,Wizards taking over the commander banlist would be awful for the format,"In the wake of the ban announcement I've seen numerous comments making the case that WotC should be taking over the banlist and giving the RC the boot. The argument is that WotC would've handled the ban announcement better and/or not chosen to ban certain cards (Jeweled Lotus &amp; Mana Crypt) at all.

Let me be clear, ceding control to WotC would unequivocally be worse for the format of commander.

My biggest fear coming out of this whole debacle is that the RC has now given WotC the ammunition it needs to take over. There are enough people calling for blood that it's easy for WotC to take over and say it was something the community was asking for.

As much as you personally detest the ban decision (or at least the way it was communicated) the decisions made by WotC would be so much worse. The situation would then be the same as for other constructed formats of magic: an organization with the most blatant conflict of interest deciding which cards are legal.

Remember Hullbreacher? Leovold? If you think that the bans for Mana Crypt and Jewled Lotus came too late, imagine how long it will take WotC to want to ban a flashy new rare or mythic from its most recent tentpole set. We've already seen from The One Ring that WotC is willing to put off bannings for signature cards from a recent set.

My sincere hope is for the RC to somehow repair its reputation and avoid a WotC takeover.",/r/EDH/comments/1frli1y/wizards_taking_over_the_commander_banlist_would/

818,AITA for relying too much on my parents after losing my husband in an accident while I was pregnant? ,"I (28F) lost my husband (32M) last year in a workplace accident while I was 8 months pregnant with our daughter. The grief has been overwhelming, and I haven‚Äôt been able to manage things on my own since his death.

After the accident, I moved in with my parents because I couldn‚Äôt handle being in our home without him. My daughter is now 9 months old, and my parents have been my main source of support, helping me with everything‚Äîfrom taking care of my daughter to handling finances. They‚Äôve been amazing, but I know I‚Äôm leaning heavily on them.

Recently, my family members have started to express concerns, saying I need to start getting my life together for my daughter‚Äôs sake. They think I‚Äôve been relying on my parents too much and that it‚Äôs time for me to move back into my own place and take on more responsibility. My brother, in particular, has said that it‚Äôs selfish of me to continue living with my parents and not to be making any real efforts to move forward after almost a year.

I haven‚Äôt gone back to work yet, and I haven‚Äôt started grief counseling, which they‚Äôve been pushing me to do. But I‚Äôm still struggling with the thought of managing everything on my own. The idea of moving out and being alone with my daughter feels overwhelming.

AITA for still depending on my parents, or should I be taking more responsibility for my daughter and our future?

850,"Despite being 18 and having a fifth grade reading level, I managed to finish reading my first book.","Earlier I talked about the fact that I've never read books in my life, which has made me functionally illiterate, unable to read complicated texts and understand and interpret them.

I had already tried to read a book called ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" but I only managed to read three chapters because it was  difficult.

But now I've managed to read a book I had at home about a boy who looks after his grandmother, by a writer called Roald Dal.

The book I have is in English and not in Portuguese or Spanish (my languages) but it's the simplest one I have.

It was really difficult to read and understand the story because my brain doesn't work well and because I've never read before.

Understanding and imagining the story, getting to the end without giving up, a few words (but as I said, English is not my language).

Another thing I liked about the book was that it had nice illustrations which helped a lot, unfortunately books for adults my age don't have them :(

Now I have a Portuguese book from the 80s, it also looks simple and it's in my mother tongue, I'll see if I can read it.",/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/1frnsg1/despite_being_18_and_having_a_fifth_grade_reading/

- The Robot fucking blanked. GANDHI ALWAYS WINS.

- Gvardiol finally scored, giving the middle finger to all the transfers out in Wildcards this week.

- Raya‚Äôs bullshit injury mystery was a complete waste of time, Arsenal defenders all drop points for being useless.

- ‚ÄúWhew, Haaland blanked after I captained Saka over him. Can‚Äôt wait for Saka to haul against Leicester at home!‚Äù

- Cole Palmer gets 4 goals in one half. I don‚Äôt own him so I could afford Saka. Really wouldn‚Äôt mind a hug from someone right about now.

- Everton won a game of football. With a McNeil brace. I have seen it all. (Also DCL owners, I dunno what you expected tbh)

- Diaz blank, Liverpool clean sheet wiped, Trent booked. 

- I also took Konate and Robinson out of my WC draft, and put in Wood. Can you tell I‚Äôve had a really good week.

So with all that mind I‚Äôd like to cash in my prediction for tomorrow: Ipswich 2-0 Aston Villa.

I tend to fly almost every week for work and the things people try to pull on flights is beyond annoying these days. Always trying to take seats that are not theirs, holding up boarding or just being plain rude.  Today I got a great laugh at a seat taker. She got all comfy in seat 8d with her mom I guess, so you would have thought it was her seat. Well lo and behold, the right seat owner comes up and of course says, excuse me, but you‚Äôre in my seat. I am positioned well to hear the convo as I am in 8C. The seat stealer then says ‚Äúcan you just move to my seat as I want to sit by my mother‚Äù.  The person who‚Äôs it was, ask, what seat is it and seat stealer says ‚Äú35B‚Äù! I don‚Äôt know what came over me, but I blurted out ‚Äúare you f‚Äîking serious?! Move to 35B from 8D? You‚Äôre crazy.  Seat stealer got embarrassed as everyone started laughing at her and the person whose seat it was promptly said no.  So seat stealer had to get her ass up and head to the back, glaring at me as she did so.  As she glared, I told her, ‚Äúyou can glare at me all you want, but your ass is still going back to 35B!‚Äù  Felt good to put seat stealer in her place. Small victories matter!

921,My Daughter and her Family have moved in with us.,"So, about 2 months ago my daughter called me up crying.  Her and her hubby's job (same place) cut their hours way back.  Her hubby went from 40 to 8, and she went from 32 to 24.  She was behind in rent, bills, etc.  Is there any way I can help her.  So I did.  I paid her utilities and got them turned back on.  I don't want my grandchildren in a house without power, heat, and water.  I also paid their Verizon bill so they had phones.  I also started talking to them about the future.  They had been looking for new jobs but in the town they live in (12k people) there wasn't a ton to be had.  Unemployment was high.  So after a few conversations we came up with a plan, before they became homeless.  Move up here with Dad and Step-Mom, and use that as a springboard to get jobs and a house of their own up here.

So far, things aren't bad.  My son-in-law kicked butt re-organizing my garage to make room (temporary) for the things they couldn't bring into my house.  Things like couches and a ton of boxes of stuff they don't need immediately.  They got connected up with a program here locally that's helping them look for housing and jobs, and will even pay their deposit and help with utilities for 3 months.

The only down side really, is the noise level.  Our house went from 2 50+ adults and a yorkie puppy who is really quiet.  To 7 people total, 2 30s adults, and 3 children under 10.  And let me tell you, they kinda suck at parenting, and because of this their kids scream and yell all the time.  

So we talked about it with them like the 3rd day, and asked them if they want us to get involved with helping them parent their children better, and they both said YES PLEASE!  So papa and grammie have been stepping in and helping them quiet their children and help them to behave better.  It's only been a week that they've been here, but things are actually a lot quieter already.

So, I know having kids move back into parents is a big thing right now.  What are your stories about your kids moving back in with you?",/r/GenX/comments/1frp5bk/my_daughter_and_her_family_have_moved_in_with_us/

* Drive older/DIY fix your vehicles. Youtube is incredible nowadays with how to fix things. 
* To the above, buy easy/cheap to repair and popular vehicles, ie not Audi, BMW, Mercedes etc. Stick with Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Honda etc. Lots of online part support and help. Also lots of used parts on eBay or in junkyard on popular models.
* Own a smaller, non-""luxurious"" home  
* Do your own lawncare, handyman work, etc
* Repair clothes when possible, such as bra support poking out 
* Cook/eat at home 98% of the time, otherwise frugal to-go meals, split and add salad at home
* Have frugal mindset from get go, downcycling product as needed (ie use old clothes for gym clothes, don't buy new gym clothes)
* Find pleasure in free/low cost activities like hiking, etc.
* Invest in yourself/skillset vs just doing a job
* Find partner that has similar viewpoints to above

80% of your expenses go to 20% of expenditures, so focus on top 20% first and once you get that under control you can focus on the bottom 80%.

After doing this and getting into the groove, you will be able to save/invest substantial % of income to allow you to leapfrog out of middle class cycle of 9-5, M-F, payment mentality and not live in fear of job loss or vehicle breakdown.",/r/MiddleClassFinance/comments/1frjqcg/if_you_want_to_escape_the_middle_class_cycle_you/

948, AITA for Refusing to Share My Lottery Winnings After My Family Abandoned Me?,"So, I recently won a massive lottery jackpot‚Äîover $1.5 million. It was life-changing, and I‚Äôm still in shock. After years of working multiple jobs and facing financial struggles, this felt like a dream come true.

Here‚Äôs where the drama kicks in: my family has a history of being unsupportive. Growing up, I was always the black sheep. My parents favored my older brother, who constantly made bad choices but still got all their attention and financial support. I‚Äôve dealt with emotional neglect for years, and when I finally moved out and started making my own way, they didn‚Äôt exactly celebrate my independence.

When I won the lottery, I decided to keep it quiet for a few weeks while I figured out what to do. But eventually, I told my parents. Their reaction? Pure shock turned into anger. They immediately started demanding that I pay off their debts and fund my brother‚Äôs new business venture (which I know will fail because he‚Äôs done it multiple times before).

I told them that I‚Äôm not obligated to share my winnings, especially after the way they treated me throughout my life. My parents called me selfish and said I‚Äôd become a ‚Äúmoney-hungry monster.‚Äù My brother even threatened to cut me out of the family if I didn‚Äôt help them.

Now, I‚Äôm torn. I want to enjoy my newfound freedom and security, but I feel guilty for not wanting to help them out after everything. I‚Äôve also thought about donating to charity or investing in my future instead of funding their poor choices.

In a nutshell: AITA for refusing to share my lottery winnings with my family who abandoned and neglected me?

I won over $1.5 million in the lottery, told my unsupportive family, and they‚Äôre demanding money. I said no, and now they‚Äôre calling me selfish.

The director making this call won‚Äôt even be at work because none of the clients will be at work. 70% of the city had no power, and funnily enough, the area didn‚Äôt even get power restored until last night.

They wanted us to come in, sit in the dark, no AC, no fans, just waiting for the power to come back on a Friday, where there will be no clients to support because nobody else is coming into work. Fuck that. The director can sit down there and when the power comes on, text me and I‚Äôll go turn his computer on and leave.

I don‚Äôt understand some people. The job is not that serious. Also making a call like this when you‚Äôre not gonna be involved and have your feet kicked up at home is crazy.

981,It‚Äôs been five years ,"I‚Äôm fifth generation Mormon pioneer in a big Mormon family. I served a mission and married in the temple. I was active 50 years including callings in the bishopric. And I am gay. 

Five years ago this month I held a temple recommend, went to church every Sunday, and took copious amounts of anti-depressants. Five years ago, I scoured the church website for advice how to be in a mixed-orientation marriage now the church upended its message on gay people from when I was young. There I found the Gospel Topics Essays. I learned the anti-Mormon ‚Äúlies‚Äù of my youth were all true and then some (Streisand effect).  

Five years ago this month I found this beautiful community on Reddit, started the painful process of deconstructing my beliefs, upending my life and building a new one. I threw my garments and recommend in the dumpster, came out to everyone about my sexuality, divorced my wife, started therapy and never attended another church service that wasn‚Äôt a funeral.  And through it all has been you beautiful strangers on Reddit. I would say God bless you all, but like most post Mormons, I‚Äôm now an atheist. 

I have a great life now that doesn‚Äôt require medication for my mental health. I married a wonderful man who as a never mo was remarkably patient through my angry phase. My weekend has two days so I‚Äôm fully rested on Monday, making me more successful at work. I make more money and pay no tithing so my retirement fund is nearly back to pre-divorce levels.  I‚Äôm free to be normal, drink coffee and wine, enjoy adult entertainment, challenge everything the church ever taught me and not be afraid of eternal punishment. My only issue is that I still get angry/sad/upset when I realize I should have always had this life but I was robbed. I guess it‚Äôs time to stop going there in my head.

When we went through the results, almost everyone at the party that didn‚Äôt know us picked one of my friends as my kids dad. Everyone thought it was hilarious and I laughed along but inwardly I was a bit upset. There were other misses too, even for the mom‚Äôs but my kid was the most frequent.  Throughout the day, my friend was joking around and saying that he‚Äôs my kids dad now. My wife thought it was funny too. 

That night when I brought it up to my wife she said that she knew that would upset me and laughed it off saying it was just a game. I casually mentioned a paternity test and she got really upset saying that I don‚Äôt trust her and how could I even think that of her. I got upset too and eventually she said go ahead and get one if I really wanted it. 

But now I‚Äôm thinking I just overreacted in the moment. Thoughts?

Edit: alright I guess I overreacted. Thanks y‚Äôall

Edit 2: the heck. Did not expect this many replies. I cannot reply to them all. Yes I know I messed up. Yes I will make things right. No I‚Äôm not going to get a test. Thanks again all!

In the end, I managed to get the Slim, Portal, Edge, and regular DualSense from a local retailer. The moment I realized that the PS1-themed cable also comes with the Slim, I was super happy. It wraps up the whole theme nicely, even if it's not the Pro.

It makes it super easy to break away from the monitors and immediately disconnect from work after clocking out. 

The shelving organization has been an on going struggle. At first I had it in alphabetical and hated it. Series chaotically bled from shelf to shelf and it just didn‚Äôt look cohesive. Separated the BL out and claimed the spaces as Non-BL and BL ü§£ The Non-BL is mostly kinda *ish* in alphabetical order while trying to keep same series on the same shelf. The BL is by publisher, then size, then alphabetical *ish* mostly *ish*

There are also a couple upside volumes. They are new additions to series I‚Äôve started, but have yet to read current through the new releases. Upside down is easier than trying to remember where I left off with what and where ü§£ Old man problems‚Ä¶

The last couple pictures are the rulers of the house and home. Solar and Scarlet. They love curling up, cuddling, snoring and farting the day away while I usually have my nose stuck in a book.

Mind you, I had only been working on a bucket hat in 1 break since I wanted to finish it before my holiday. Also, I was using public transport and wanted to use first class (which I would pay for myself, I hate travelling in extremely busy trains). 

They basically said, yeah, since you want to unwind in your breaks and afterwards, we don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre suitable for secondment work. You‚Äôre good at what you do, but you want to unwind? Nah, we‚Äôll let you go.

","I‚Äôve only just started using Reddit, and this is my first time experiencing a thread, while I watch 90 Day Fianc√©. (I‚Äôve been watching since 2018, btw.)
Seeing trans people in tv, is rare, sometimes triggering, and often traumatic. Although Faith‚Äôs presence, and circumstances, are definitely groundbreaking in reality. Her situation, however, is very common for trans people. 
We get the bottom of the barrel. Often. Think of how cis-women complain about men, and assume we get that, and then some. Often times, we‚Äôre talking about the exact same men. 
We get cheaters, we get manipulators, we get gaslighters, and we‚Äôre angry with your baby-daddy too!
Loren is the type of man who fits these categories. Unfortunately, these type of unhinged men are the only ones who would hold our hand in public. 
It‚Äôs truly so sad. To be loved, wholly. For who we are now, not, just who we ‚Äúcould‚Äù be.

1050,"Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old mother of three, died of water intoxication after participating in the 2007 ""Hold Your Wee for a Wii"" contest hosted by Sacramento radio station KDND. After drinking over 1.5 gallons of water and losing the competition, she died shortly after returning home.","By the time she left the station she might as well have been drunk, a doctor testified in her trial earlier this week. 

Strange suffered¬†hyponatremia, or acute water intoxication. 

Immediate medical care with an IV sodium drip to counteract the water might have saved her, the doctor testified. Instead, Strange went home and collapsed. She was found dead about six hours later.

1081,Penny pinching - What a cashier told us yesterday,"Yesterday my husband and I stopped in to get a rotisserie chicken and a few other essentials we can't get anywhere else. Usually when we bag our stuff we put the chicken in one of those thin produce bags in case anything happens in the car and the juices leak out. 


The cashiers always had a roll of them at their station to bag the chickens, raw meats, flour, and sugar as all of them have a tendency to leak. My husband couldn't find the bags so asked the cashier if she had one and she told us that the bigwigs came in last week and told them all to get rid of the bags at the cash. 


The cashiers also has little pots of elastics that they would use to keep egg cartons closed, or to secure lids so things wouldn't leak if it didn't seem like they were staying closed. She said they were told to get rid of those too. 


Seems like they are trying to save any kind of money they can at the customers expense once again. They don't care if your stuff spills out everywhere, they have your money. Then at the end of my transaction they have the nerve to ask if I want to donate $2.00 to whatever charity they are using for tax cuts.",/r/loblawsisoutofcontrol/comments/1fripro/penny_pinching_what_a_cashier_told_us_yesterday/

1114,Gorgeous Senior Girl Callie ,"I just wanted to share this gorgeous girl and her story.

This beautiful girl came into my life 2 years ago. I was running the foster program for a shelter, and Callie was surrendered for euthanasia because she was vomiting a lot and losing weight despite eating more than usual. The shelter vet ran blood work, and it showed Callie has hyperthyroidism, which explained all her symptoms, and was treatable with medication, so they were not comfortable euthanizing. We offered to let her owner take her back as a hospice foster so her meds and vet care would be provided for free. But due to their own life circumstances, the owner wasn't able to take her back. Having a soft spot for Calicos/Torties and having recently lost my own beloved tortie to complications of hyperthyroidism, it just felt like fate for me. I brought Callie home as a hospice foster, then officially adopted her a couple months later when I left that job. Callie is absolutely thriving at 16 years old now, and our vet thinks she still has a few more years.

I'm just so happy to have been able to be her second chance.",/r/CalicoKittys/comments/1frh85a/gorgeous_senior_girl_callie/

1128,"UPDATE - Getting Engaged Without My Dad's Blessing, Leading Him to Cut Off Contact and Refuse to Come to My Wedding","This whole thing went down about four months ago, and I hadn‚Äôt spoken to my dad since‚Äîuntil a few days ago. He texted me (which I didn‚Äôt notice right away since I‚Äôve had his notifications silenced). When I finally saw it, I was walking out of work and literally dropped everything‚ÄîRIP to my Celsius and the lip liner that rolled out of my bag, you will be missed. His message read; ‚ÄúI am texting you because we need to have a conversation.‚Äù

I debated whether to even respond, but my peace of mind (and, let‚Äôs be honest, my anxiety) got the better of me. I texted back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to having a conversation with the intention of moving forward, not rehashing the past.‚Äù We scheduled a call for the next day.

Fast forward to the call: He starts by saying he loves me and that hasn‚Äôt changed. Then, almost immediately, he switches to how upset and disappointed he is that *he* had to reach out first. (Umm‚Ä¶ what?) He then asked if we‚Äôve set a wedding date. I told him it‚Äôs late next year, hoping maybe he‚Äôd changed his mind. But nope. He followed that up with, ‚ÄúDo you have a venue?‚Äù I said yes. His response? ‚ÄúSo, this is happening. Well, I‚Äôm not telling anyone in the family not to go. That‚Äôs their choice. There aren‚Äôt sides.‚Äù

I tried to explain that there *are* sides because no one in the family knows my side of things. (I‚Äôm not super close with that side of the family, except for my grandma, who made it clear she‚Äôs on his side.) He cut me off, saying he didn‚Äôt want to be on the phone long, and that‚Äôs all he had to say.

I asked if I could ask a question before he hung up, and he agreed. So I asked, ‚ÄúDo you stand by your decision not to come?‚Äù His answer: ‚ÄúIt depends on how I‚Äôm treated.‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôm floored. I asked him to elaborate because I‚Äôve never been disrespectful to him. And then it all came out: He feels like he *deserves* the title of ‚Äúfather of the bride‚Äù and thinks it‚Äôs completely disrespectful to him if I let both him and my stepdad walk me down the aisle. He went on to double down and say that my stepdad should never have been asked because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt his blessing to give,‚Äù and he‚Äôs my *biological* father. He would only consider coming to the wedding if he‚Äôs treated with ‚Äúthe respect he deserves‚Äù by having the sole title of father of the bride.

And then, the kicker: He told me that my mom needed to call him to talk about all of this. (Um, okay?) Well, my mom is having *none* of that. She‚Äôs refusing to call him‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîand is protecting her peace. As she should. If he wants to talk to her, he can pick up the phone and let her know that himself.

I‚Äôm still reeling. Originally, I was fully planning on sending him an invite, but now? I don‚Äôt even know what to say. The whole thing feels so‚Ä¶ messed up. My fianc√©‚Äôs parents are upset, and so are my mom and stepdad. I‚Äôm honestly at a loss.

I didn‚Äôt expect to be giving an update this soon‚Äîor at all. But here we are. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since that call and am thinking about writing a letter to him. I want to take a few days to calm down first, though, before I decide anything. If I do send something, I‚Äôll update again. For now, this is where things stand.",/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1freson/update_getting_engaged_without_my_dads_blessing/

Then about 4 minutes in i realize i forgot my resume and had to turn around to get it, so i would just barely make it on time. Then on the highway, my GPS told me to take the express lane, and while I was on there I missed a lane change, and ended up on the wrong highway, and it‚Äôll take an extra 16 minutes to get there. 15 minutes late is bad, but not that bad, i could recover from that. But then when i get to the place my GPS was directing me, I realized i put in the WRONG ADDRESS! I was in the right city, but the place was a little more than 20 minutes away. I pull over at this point i am sobbing and my make up is a mess, I call my dad asking what to do, he says call them so I do.

More McBeef over the validity of OP's recall of events, with one user suggesting he was pranked  
  
""[I don't care if you got autism and the reason why I want to assume you are making it up a story i give the details on how the door works.  The doors are larger than the doorway itself. They actually set in a resses in the freezer entrance so the gaskets can make a seal. There are no latches that hold the door closed. The only mechanisms for the door closing are the spring hinges and the door assist.  The door assist helps hold the door in the closed position and helps when opening the door.  If the events did happen to you, I will provide you with a possible alternative as to why.  You were the victim of a prank.  Someone (probably the person who let you out) followed you when you went to get the product.  They held the door closed so you couldn't get it open right away and waited for you to start to panic.  After they get their laugh at making you panic, they let you out.  You were most likely in there a total of 5 minutes, not 20. While under duress, such as panicking, a person's sense of time becomes dilated.  You were probably freaking freaking the fuck out since you thought you were trapped.

RNs at MGH are now being paid MORE than NPs and PAs. The oversaturation of midlevels is starting to show. In the near future, an RN will be more valuable than an NP due to scarcity.

NPs are expectedly fuming at this reality and rallying their troops/unions to force a raise for midlevels, which it seems MGH is begrudgingly agreeing to.

1218,A loyalist space marine is mistaken for a chaos space marine,"Source: Oaths of Damnation  
  
Context: A Guardswoman almost just died fighting some cultists, but at the last moment a loyalist Exorcist space marine Riever arrives and saves her.



&gt;The giant‚Äôs skull was bare, the tough skin criss-crossed with scars, while his forehead seemed to have been branded with another foul rune. Worst of all was the mask covering the lower half of his face, fashioned to resemble what looked like a daemon‚Äôs skeletal jaw, all wicked leer and vicious, bared fangs.

&gt;Jair knew that he was death and damnation, given form and now come to claim both her body and her soul.¬†

&gt;\[...\]

&gt;In that moment she forgot everything else, forgot her pride and her faith and even her beloved brother, lying dead beside her.¬†

&gt;‚ÄòPlease,‚Äô she managed, voice a dull croak. ‚ÄòPlease, don‚Äôt kill me.‚Äô

&gt;The giant stared stared down at her, and she stared back, into those brown eyes, so dark they were almost black, their inhumanity only accentuated by that daemonic skull grin. The pair shared a strange, brief moment of total stillness. Then, abruptly, he turned away.

&gt;He left, having not said a word, stepping out into the harsh daylight. Just like that, he was gone, leaving Jair kneeling in the blood and the dust, shaking but alive.



&gt;'Curious,‚Äô Zaidu mused as he moved off again, down the rutted track that passed for one of the shanty town‚Äôs streets.

&gt;‚Äò*What was?*‚Äô Vey‚Äôs voice clicked in his ear.

&gt;‚ÄòA soldier of the Astra Militarum. She just begged me not to end her.‚Äô

&gt;‚Äò*Unsurprising,‚Äô Vey said with the merest hint of humour. ‚ÄòWe know the spawn of Lorgar are operating on this world. To a common member of the Guard, caught up in the midst of combat, we might be confused with the enemy.*‚Äô

&gt;‚ÄòSurely not,‚Äô Zaidu said incredulously, disgusted at the mere suggestion.

&gt;

I love this excerpt since it brutally captures the just massive gap between mortals and space marines, and even shows how the line between space marines and chaos space marines are blurred, since both are just so far away from mortal‚Äôs lives. It really highlights just how inhuman space marines really are.

1231,I slept with my half brother without knowing (don‚Äôt judge before you read),"So I 27 female was going to get married a few days ago until I got the most shocking news of my life 
So I was going to marry Jack (fake name) we had been together for about 3/4 years. Our relationship was perfect 
We had a great sex life and everything was perfect he treated me well we rarely fought.
So back to the present day 
About a month before my wedding I got a call from jacks father and asked to meet both of us 
We all met in a coffee shop in our town and jacks father let‚Äôs call him bob dropped an absolute bomb on us 
He told me he was my father 
I never met my father before I thought he had died before I was born but now you‚Äôre telling me that I‚Äôve been sleeping with my half brother and we were going to get married ?????? 
I honestly had no words 
We called of the wedding for obvious reasons but bob knew we we‚Äôre together for years 
Why only tell us like a week before our wedding 
Im not really sure how to go about telling my family and friends so any advice is welcome üôè 

UPDATE!!!!
Thanks to all who gave me advice and no I‚Äôm not a high school kid I‚Äôm 27 ffs. 
So I met my mom today. Turns out Bob isn‚Äôt mine or jacks father. My father died when I was born (which was what I was told before) and jacks father was in a nursing home and passed away (jacks mom and dad divorced before Jack was born and jacks father wanted nothing to do with him). 
Turns out bob wanted me and Jack to split up and get with me (a lot of yous said that in the comments so don‚Äôt come at me plsüòÖüòÖ) but I have no intention of doing that. 
Me and jacks wedding is back on and we‚Äôll be happily married next week. 
Thanks for all the support and lads if you think this is fake. Okay‚Ä¶

1233,MMW - Harris will win North Carolina and Arizona.,"Mark Robinson is the best campaigner for Democrats. His scandals will significantly hurt Trump and other Republicans down ballot. Independents would ask themselves, why did Republicans nominate this man, and impact their perspective on Republicans. Plus Harris campaigned a LOT in North Carolina even before his Porn-Site scandal came out, so she might‚Äôve known something or internal polling showed it more competitive than we think.

She will also win Arizona. The Trump in high heels Kari Lake lost in 2022 despite being ahead by 3-4 points in the polls. Kari Lake campaigned on Immigration and Economy issues like Trump is, she was seen as the ‚ÄúTrump in high heels‚Äù, Katie Hobbs ran a terrible campaign by not showing up to the debate and having bad interviews, and still narrowly defeated Trump in high heels Kari Lake. Not to mention the Abortion Referendum and Border city Republicans putting ‚ÄúCountry before Party‚Äù and endorsing Harris, the same way the McCain‚Äôs endorsed Biden in 2020.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it will be close, but it seems like Harris will win Arizona and North Carolina.",/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1fregvk/mmw_harris_will_win_north_carolina_and_arizona/

All my life women have fetishized my height, especially the 4 foot nothing hobbits who somehow think we're in the same league height wise.

I got a bit sick of their entitlement and now I just reply with ''what's your bra size'?' and that completely shuts them off or they start insulting me, which makes it even funnier. It also shows you just how comfortable females have become with double standards when it comes to objectification and body shaming.

Today 28-29 September 2024 my friend has saved me and he doesn't know.

I (18f) had everything planned out. I wrote a letter for my boyfriend apologising. Telling him I love him and that I'll always love him and more things. I went on about my day. I got ready for the day around 12am. I went outside to hangout with someone untill 3:30pm. After that I was just wandering around listening music until 4:40pm and I went in to work. I went to work from 5pm till 8pm. I was talking, making conversations and doing what I had to do.
After work I was ready to get everything set up for the attempt until I saw I had a text. The text read ""hey can u come outside?"" So I called him. We went to hangout around 8:30pm. We got ourselves some drinks and walked around the village for hours and talked about life. I told him about the fights me and my boyfriend have sometimes.
We talked about our past, our love lives, our families, about that time we injured our arm and more. We talked for hours and hours. Around 10:15pm we went to a snackbar to get something to eat. We talked some more and more walking around the entire city, we laughed and shared some stories and jokes.
Around 00:20 we said our goodbyes. Around midnight I would've been gone. That was the plan at least. Today I was being saved by my friend and he doesn't know. I don't think I'll ever tell him either.",/r/confession/comments/1frqjo1/my_friend_saved_me_from_y_attempt_today_and_he/

Monday I have a stress test and an ECHO so I'm thinking me not feeling well today has something to do with that but I couldn't stick out my 12 hour day at work and decided to just go home so I could sleep. 

On my home, on a back road, I passed what I realized was a pet carrier on the side of the road. Even though I was tired and just wanted to get home, I decided to turn around and check it out just in case. 

I'm glad I did cause I found this. The door on the pet carrier was open, but it was too scared to even turn to face the open door. Until I had it safely in my car did it turn to show me what I had picked up. 

I currently have it (sorry I keep referring to it, as it but I don't know the sex yet) in my spare bedroom with some food and a litter box. I'm going to give it a little space and take a nap myself, and then I'll see if I can get a closer look at it.

So, I found out I passed my board exam, the USMLE Step 2, a few weeks ago and I wanted to get a new bag to commemorate my achievement! I‚Äôve had my eye on the Bottega Veneta Andiamo bag for months now, and when I was browsing Vestiaire Collective, I saw that this bag popped up. It was new and unused from a reputable seller, had the certificate of craft gold card, original dust bag, the receipts from the purchase, and it was $2000 off the US retail price excluding taxes. I just knew I had to get him, and I think he‚Äôs a wonderful addition to my handbag family. I think I‚Äôm done purchasing handbags for this year, but if and when I match into residency next year, who knows? Maybe another handbag might find itself in my collection.

1344,"THIS IS A SHITPOSTING SUBREDDIT, GIRLIES","There's been quite the surge in activity here lately, so we think it's time the community had a brief refresher on what this place is all about.

The pinned post from our glorious cult leader put it better than I could so I'll just direct you all to read or re-read that here:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/femcelgrippysockjail/s/hCeKmP8OO7

But to go over some basics,

This is NOT your safe space, and I don't mean that in a mean way or anything! There are plenty of subreddits on this site where you can go for your mental health needs and support! We're not saying ""ermm... triggered, libral??"" or anything. Please, go seek those out if you need them. This just isn't a safe space. This place is a shithole, this place is a PvP enabled zone. This is a place for girls to have the same kind of freedom to be deranged, schizo, or depraved the way guys have all their edgy boy humor subs. We are very sorry if something in here is offensive, or hurtful, or not up to your moral standards, but coming here and expecting peace and quiet is like going to a paintball field for some quiet reading time. There's nothing wrong with quiet reading time! But the girls are playing paintball here, and there is a library a couple clicks away on this magical website.


This is NOT a place for your genuine misandry and hate! That is against reddit's TOS and we are all innocent little angels (like all girls, obviously üòá) and everything here is just being silly. We are all just joking and talking about doing things in minecraft and making galaxy brain social commentary on how we live in a society. If you've found yourself here looking for a genuine femcel subreddit to post your manifesto, this probably is not the right place.


There is no rule that men are not allowed here, that would be against reddit TOS. However, we do decline any posts ""looking for gf"" or ""hello i'm a moid, etc"" that are here to troll or stir up trouble, and we do ban trolls who are only here to create problems. There is no restriction on what genders are allowed to post here, just make sure your posts are funny and match the vibe.


This isn't a femcel-only space, this isn't an unironic femcel sub at all actually. You are welcome here if you aren't a virgin, or have a relationship, or whatever. This is a place to post dumb memes and shitpost. Please. It really is not that serious.

And this is just my own personal note, as I've seen quite a few ""serious femcels"" who are also active in r slash teenagers, please girl just go outside üò≠üò≠üò≠ this is a meme subreddit first and foremost, but if you're in here claiming to be a femcel extremist of some kind because Kyle in your math class was bothering you please stop omg go do your homework and ride your bike please üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠


All posts requiring mod approval was originally meant to be a temporary thing after the fishposting arc but it really does help so much with controlling the chaos in here so it's probably going to be permanent.


TL;DR


PLEASE. It really is not that serious. We are here to shitpost.

The mod team has already discussed our next tourist lockdown protocol in case things really get out of hand here, so this is your warning. We've done fishposting, and we could do worse.


We love all of you xoxo please keep being crazy üêüüíï",/r/femcelgrippysockjail/comments/1frlbe1/this_is_a_shitposting_subreddit_girlies/

Not all of you know Hassan, but he has been here with /r/NonCredibleDiplomacy since the begenning. Passionate about escalataion risks and diplomacy with non state actors Hassan has always been enthusiastic about diplomacy. Some of his other hobbies include aerial photography, politics and travel in the greater Levant region

Dying at just 64 years of age, the world really did take him young. He is apparently succeeded by a wife and five children. We are told that in his private life he ran some sort of large NGO, which makes it all the more impressive that he has managed to do around 90% of the moderation since then

Anyways, I ask that we all pray for Hassan's soul and hope that he can do plenty of aerial photography and escalation dynamics in heaven üòá",/r/NonCredibleDiplomacy/comments/1frdib7/rnoncrediblediplomacy_moderator_hassan_from/

So I'm on the couch and he's up big over Oregon with a quarter to go. I say alright that's enough and grab the second controller. He didn't realize this was a possibility. 

I score a few of touchdowns to cut it to 2 but the clock is getting low. He fakes a punt from his own 10 with 20 seconds left because he's a YOLO play caller from the Chip Kelly coaching tree. I get to the 2 yard line with a second left. Timeout. Line up for the easy fg. 

As soon as I snap the ball I notice the kicker is taking forever to start his walk up. I know what this means. Sure enough the animation is locked into a blocked fg as time expires. 

I of course immediately told him it doesn't count in the all time standings under the rules of dad-son gaming. But his smile was almost enough for me to count it. ",/r/NCAAFBseries/comments/1frlhhm/i_lost_to_my_5_year_old_son/

""Put your phone away"" ... ""I need to text my moms brother's sister about my ride home""

""Open your book and follow along"" ... ""But I'm so cold""

""Refocus on your work"" ... ""Yea but this is so useless when will I ever need to multiply""

""Get your bellringer out"" ... ""I'm in high school why do I need to do bellringers""

""You need to get into your seat"" ... "" Why is it a big deal I want to wander around the room""

I do not know when it started for students to have the belief everything is a conversation where they are never in  the wrong but it is exhausting.

**Mood Spoiler:** &gt;!things are looking up!&lt;

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fhlba7/aitah_for_telling_my_sisters_boyfriend_to_get_out/)**: September 15, 2024**

So, here‚Äôs what happened: I (28F) invited my sister (25F) and her boyfriend (26M) over for dinner. I love cooking and had spent hours preparing this fancy meal: homemade pasta, a slow-cooked ragu, a salad, and a tiramisu for dessert. I was really proud of it and excited to have them over.

When they arrived, everything was fine at first. We sat down, and I started serving the food. Her boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him Steve) stared at the pasta for a moment, then looked at me and said, ""I don‚Äôt eat carbs.""

At first, I thought he was joking, but nope‚Äîhe was dead serious. He goes on about how he‚Äôs ""super into keto"" and ""carbs are the enemy."" Okay, fine, that‚Äôs his choice. But when I offered to make him a salad or something else on the spot, he refused and said that I should have known about his diet beforehand.

This is where it gets weird. He then pulls out a small Tupperware container from his bag (!!!), filled with what looked like boiled chicken and broccoli, and starts to eat it at my dinner table while the rest of us are trying to enjoy the meal I spent hours making.

I was stunned and, honestly, kind of insulted. I told him it was rude to bring his own food without mentioning it to me beforehand, and he should have at least given me a heads-up. He then goes off about how people need to ""respect his dietary choices"" and that I was being ""controlling"" by not accommodating his needs.

At this point, I‚Äôd had enough. I told him, ""If you can‚Äôt eat what‚Äôs served and won‚Äôt even let me make something else, then maybe you should just get out."" He stood up, said something like ""I‚Äôm just trying to be healthy,"" grabbed his Tupperware, and walked out. My sister stayed for a bit but eventually left too, saying I overreacted.

Now my sister‚Äôs mad at me, saying I embarrassed her boyfriend and made them both feel unwelcome. My mom thinks I should apologize, but my friends are on my side, saying Steve was being incredibly rude.

AITAH for telling him to get out?

***OOP's Comment/Top Comment:***

Commenter: Your sister didn't give you a heads up about his diet?

&gt;**OOP:** Honestly, no, she didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure if she even knew how serious he was about the whole keto thing because she never mentioned it. She eats pretty much anything, so I assumed he was the same. But even if she had, I feel like it still would‚Äôve been polite for him to at least say something beforehand instead of just showing up with his own meal. I would‚Äôve happily made something keto-friendly if I had known!

***There is no consensus bot on AITAH, but top comments were NTA***

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fmb7v5/update_aitah_for_telling_my_sisters_boyfriend_to/)**: September 21, 2024 (6 days later)**

Well, y‚Äôall, buckle up because things have escalated in a way I never expected. After my initial post, I figured things would calm down once my sister had time to cool off. Spoiler alert: they did not.

So, the day after I told Steve to leave, my sister texts me saying they want to ""talk things through"" at a family dinner. I assumed it would be just the three of us, maybe at a neutral restaurant, where we could hash it out like adults. Nope. Instead, my sister invites my parents, my brother,¬†*and*¬†Steve‚Äôs parents to this ""dinner"" at my parents' house, turning it into some kind of weird intervention.

I show up thinking it‚Äôll just be a casual conversation, but the moment I walk in, Steve‚Äôs mom (let‚Äôs call her Carol) is already going off about how ""Steve has always had special dietary needs"" and how ‚Äúpeople who care about him should respect his boundaries.‚Äù The woman acts like the guy has a life-threatening allergy, not a trendy diet. My mom is sitting there looking super uncomfortable, while my dad‚Äôs just quietly sipping his beer, clearly wishing he were anywhere else.

So, Carol starts listing off Steve‚Äôs dietary restrictions, and she‚Äôs acting like I¬†*personally*¬†offended the whole keto community by serving pasta. Then‚Äîbrace yourselves‚ÄîCarol pulls out a¬†*folder.*¬†Yes, a literal folder, with printouts. She hands one to me, one to my mom, and one to my dad. I‚Äôm flipping through this thing, and it‚Äôs full of Steve‚Äôs ""dietary guidelines,"" suggested meal plans, and even a list of keto-friendly restaurants we could go to ""in the future.""

At this point, I‚Äôm doing everything I can not to laugh, but it gets worse. Steve pipes up and says he‚Äôs¬†*willing to forgive me*¬†for ""disrespecting his lifestyle"" if I agree to host a redo dinner where I follow his dietary restrictions¬†*to the letter*. He says this will prove I‚Äôm ‚Äúserious‚Äù about making amends and respecting his needs going forward. I thought he was joking, but no‚Äîhe was dead serious. He even pulled out his phone to show me some keto recipe apps that I ""might find helpful.""

I was in total shock. My sister, by the way, said absolutely nothing during all of this, just staring at her plate like she wanted to disappear. My mom, bless her, tries to smooth things over by suggesting we all just eat whatever we want when we‚Äôre together, but Carol snaps, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple!‚Äù She says that in their family, they ""all follow keto together,"" and that‚Äôs why Steve is so ""passionate"" about it.

At this point, I‚Äôve had enough. I stood up and said, ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not redoing the dinner. I‚Äôm not making anyone a special keto feast. If Steve can‚Äôt eat what I cook, that‚Äôs fine, but bringing his own meal to my dinner without even telling me was disrespectful, and I‚Äôm not apologizing for feeling that way.‚Äù

And then‚Äîthis is where it gets absolutely bonkers‚ÄîSteve‚Äôs dad stands up, points at me, and says, ‚ÄúThis is exactly why Steve doesn‚Äôt trust¬†*women*¬†to understand him. They always make it about themselves.‚Äù The whole room went silent. My dad finally spoke up, saying, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for you all to leave,‚Äù and started walking toward the door, basically¬†*escorting*¬†Steve‚Äôs parents out.

Steve and my sister stayed behind, but Steve was furious. He started yelling about how ‚Äúfamily should support each other,‚Äù and then accused me of trying to sabotage their relationship because I‚Äôm ‚Äújealous‚Äù of what they have. At that point, I just walked out and left the whole mess behind.

Here‚Äôs the kicker, though: a couple of days later, my sister called me and told me she and Steve were taking a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù because she ‚Äúneeded time to think.‚Äù Apparently, this whole keto fiasco was the last straw in a long list of controlling behavior from Steve. She didn‚Äôt realize just how bad it was until the whole family saw it play out at dinner. She even told me that Steve had been trying to get¬†*her*¬†to follow his diet for months, but she was hiding snacks in her car just to get a break from all the keto madness!

So now, Steve‚Äôs gone full radio silent, my sister is staying with me for the time being, and I‚Äôm still getting passive-aggressive texts from Carol about ‚Äúhow hurt Steve is‚Äù and how ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just misunderstood.‚Äù Honestly, I‚Äôm just glad my sister is finally seeing how controlling this guy was.

TL;DR: Steve‚Äôs keto obsession led to a full-blown family intervention where his mom handed out dietary guidelines, and now my sister is taking a break from him because she realized how controlling he is.",/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1fr5zh4/aitah_for_telling_my_sisters_boyfriend_to_get_out/

I heard branches crack in the brush behind me. 

‚ÄúHey, Daniel.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Mark,‚Äù I replied. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs well as can be expected, I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Look, mom and dad are worried about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? You don‚Äôt come by the house anymore. You don‚Äôt return calls. All you do is sit by this river every day. It isn‚Äôt healthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHealthy?‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúWell, given that the love of my life died in agony, you‚Äôll understand if *my* health isn't my primary concern.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, of course not, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶ Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúForget it.‚Äù

We sat quietly by the riverbank.

‚ÄúDid you know the police said Mary was conscious when the car went into the water? Apparently they can tell by the scratches inside the trunk. Trapped in the trunk, fully aware of what was happening to her.  I sometimes wonder what it must have been like for her. How terrified she must have been.‚Äù

Mark was silent. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs horrible. I don‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôm so sorry, Danny.‚Äù

I was quiet for a few more minutes. 

‚ÄúDid you know she was pregnant?‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs mouth dropped. 

‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt told anyone yet. She‚Äôd wanted to wait until after the first trimester. We were thinking Sarah for a girl or John for a boy. Her parents‚Äô names. I was finally going to have a family of my own.‚Äù

‚ÄúDanny, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I could have even had what you and Jennifer have.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the way, did you know Mary always carried an emergency cell phone?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah - she was terrible at remembering to charge her iPhone, so she always carried a little flip phone in case the battery died.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe called me from it the night she died. She‚Äôd just woken up and thought she was in the trunk of a car. She was scared - she begged me to help her.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awful! Did she say anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what? Like seeing you and your assistant through your bedroom window when she‚Äôd come to pick up some things for Jennifer? Leaving quickly, hoping you hadn‚Äôt seen her? Getting out of her car when she felt something strike her head and then coming to in the trunk?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, Danny, I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to say anything, Mark. I know it was you.‚Äù

Mark was silent. 

‚ÄúThe irony is, she wasn‚Äôt even going to say anything. She‚Äôd decided it wasn‚Äôt her business. You murdered her for nothing.‚Äù

More silence.

‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúMe? Nothing. You‚Äôre my brother.‚Äù

I heard him sigh in relief and looked over to where he sat, watching as the bloated corpse covered in water and seaweed rose behind him like a terrifying, vengeful god come to life.

1471,Ex trad wife here..,"Hi everyone,
former trad wife here.. yea, I know üòí .. and it ended in the worst case but typical scenario.
He lived a double life with prostitutes and tinder dates on the side, was incredibly emotionally psychologically abusive to me and our 3 children. He was totally absent at home and entirely uninvolved with raising the children as well. And after having gone through hell for the last 10 years, I've finally had the guts to break myself free from this narcessist piece of sh*t.
He instantly did what they all do.. he cut the kids &amp; I off entirely financially (2 toddlers and a small child).
We're now absolutely penniless and I have a long and ugly battle ahead of me in order to receive pocket change from this vile being, as so many women do.
He makes well over $10,000 a month and all he'll owe me is a lousy $1,300 a month in child support for 3 kids. Which is pocket change for him, and an absolute insult considering how much he's making!

I hate these red pilled morons who claim ""wimmin"" get everything after divorce and leave these poor men penniless when obviously the opposite of this is true!

Anyways, I was looking for community here on reddit, but couldn't find any ex trad wife sub-reddit. Surely there has to be one is there?
I also checked on Facebook for a group, but nothing. This can't be can it.. I know there's countless of women who fell victim of not only the scam that marriage is for us women, but also for the stay at home mom aka trad wife lifestyle...
Do any of you know of some groups I could join on any social media platform by any chance?
I'd also love to be able to talk to women about the scam of marriage in general, whom have been through it..

I truly hope this new generation of females will finally start to decenter men and begin to have actual STANDARDS if they do want to team up with a man.
We can go on forever about how horrible these men are, and I have so SO much to tell in that regard, but the bottom line is.. they'll never change unless we stop enabling their rotten behavior by dating &amp; marrying them, and birthing their offspring for them and raising them on our own basically.
Which also brings me to the fact that women need to stop raising these entitled narcessistic men, it all starts in the home and I see far too many moms perpetuating the misogy at home by teaching their boys &amp; girls misogynistic standards basically. I have 2 boys and a girl, and I am on it! I do not pickup after my boys and call them out non stop every time they leave things laying on the floor etc.. and I also stop my daughter when she does it for them.
She'll sometimes pick something off the floor wanting to put it away or throw it in the trash if it's a wrapper or whatever, which is kind of a normal instinct if you see something on the floor that shouldn't be there, but I'll stop her and tell her that it isn't her responsibility to clean up their messes and that we're all responsible to do it ourselves.
I also make the boys use their words, and do all I can for them to develop emotional intelligence, which is one of the root causes of toxic male behavior.
Lack of emotional intelligence makes you by default an abuser, and we need to stop normalizing this in boys by calling it ""boys will be boys"", which is my monster in law's motto as is no surprise.
In the case of my narcessistic soon to be- ex husband, I hate to say it but his mother truly created this beast. She didn't parent him in any way shape or form, does everything for him to this day..simple tasks that any grown up adult should be able to perform, sides with him no matter how rotten his behavior &amp; vile immoral unethical actions, and would without ANY doubt side with him if he were to m*rder the kids and I, like we see so many mothers of wife m*rderers do.. Scott Peterson's &amp; Chris Watt's mothers just to name a few...
I truly can see why my ex turned out the way he did. His mother practically trained him to be this way, and while genetics also play a massive role that isn't ever talked about (I have SO much to say in that regard!), mother's roles in the outcome of these toxic men need to be addressed.
Clearly his father is just as culpable for not parenting his son whatsoever, like most men, but it wasn't his hands off- approach that turned my ex into the narcessistic vile abuser he is, it truly was his mother's systematic enabling to this day btw.

Nothing will change unless and until we as women do, period. We weren't able to in the past, but we are now, and I'm excited for the new generation of women for that and truly hope they finally make use of it...

1472,Are the straights okay? Why are you coming to a gay club and getting mad? üòÇ,Last night I was at a gay club. I was literally just in-line at the bar to order a drink. There was a TV on the wall to my right and I was watching it because it was showing a Charli XCX music video. All of a sudden this guy (who was standing under the tv) goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gay‚Äù and starts getting aggressive with me and his girlfriend is like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs straight sorry.‚Äù I just looked at them like wtf? If I‚Äôm in a straight club and a girl hits on me or tries to dance I just politely decline and we usually end up becoming bffs and dancing together just not sexually.

until you turn it to the side, and it‚Äôs engraved with katniss flowers. (inspiration is pic 3)

if any of you know, katniss and peeta from the hunger games are each others true love after so much hardship.

ive always had a deep connection to Katniss and the series.. I always yearned for a deep true love just like Katniss and Peeta (so cliche I know) and i‚Äôve been obsessed with the series since i was younger.

My fiance loves me so unconditionally, so I know i‚Äôve found my Peeta (this is what he told me after he proposed and explained his process of creating my ring) 

My fiance decided to get the flowers of Katniss engraved on my engagement ring to kind of symbolize that.

i know its so cliche and maybe a bit silly but i just wanted to share ‚ô° it‚Äôs so unassuming to be a ‚Äúhunger games inspired ring‚Äù but it has the most beautiful story to it",/r/EngagementRings/comments/1frgtc8/my_hunger_games_inspired_ring/

1537,Found out my grandpa faked his death,"When I got my results a few months ago, I saw someone I did not know that I share 13% DNA with. I could tell we were related maternally. At first I thought my mom's brother had gotten someone pregnant when he was about 14 years old and this person I was related to was my first cousin. But then I logged into my mom's Ancestry account and saw she shares 20-30% DNA with two women with the same last name as the guy on 23andMe and they were older than him. The only possibility is that these people are my mom's half siblings and my half uncle and half aunts. 

This is crazy because my mom's dad went missing from his boat on the ocean when my mom was a young child. His body was never found, he was presumed drowned and declared deceased. My mom's whole life she thought he dad had died. But it turns out he remarried 10 years after his disappearance and had four children. They knew him by another name. He then disappeared from the 2nd family about 6 years after being married. His 2nd disappearance made it seem like he may have died too.

1651,Novas regras de postagem,"Ol√° a todos,

A partir de hoje, iniciaremos um teste no qual todas as novas postagens precisar√£o passar pela aprova√ß√£o da modera√ß√£o antes de se tornarem vis√≠veis para a comunidade. Esse modelo ser√° experimentado nas pr√≥ximas semanas e foi pensado devido ao grande crescimento que tivemos recentemente, o que tornou essencial mantermos um controle maior para garantir a qualidade das postagens.

Nos √∫ltimos cinco meses, nossa comunidade cresceu de 5 mil para 40 mil membros. Com esse aumento, tamb√©m veio um n√∫mero maior de postagens fora do tema. A equipe de modera√ß√£o tem trabalhado bastante para remover esses posts, mas muitos deles acabam sendo visualizados por diversas pessoas antes de serem exclu√≠dos, o que pode ter dado a impress√£o de que n√£o h√° modera√ß√£o ativa ‚Äî mas isso n√£o √© verdade.

A atividade de modera√ß√£o, √© algo cansativo e √© feita por uma equipe de volunt√°rios que est√° aqui para garantir que o subreddit mantenha seu foco e prop√≥sito. N√£o faz muito tempo, nosso subreddit estava desativado por falta de modera√ß√£o. A nova equipe se voluntariou para reviver a comunidade, e desde ent√£o temos trabalhado para mant√™-la ativa e interessante para todos. Dentre isso estipulamos as regras do sub, ativamos auto bots para remover postagens repetidas e mecanismos para controle de postagens fora da proposta do sub.

Pedimos a compreens√£o de todos enquanto realizamos esse teste. E se tiverem alguma sugest√£o ou feedback, basta nos enviar um modmail. O objetivo √© manter a qualidade e relev√¢ncia das postagens, e garantir que a comunidade continue crescendo de forma saud√°vel.

Obrigado por estarem conosco nessa jornada!

Atenciosamente,

A Equipe de Modera√ß√£o",/r/NaoMortoAbraDentro/comments/1frmjo3/novas_regras_de_postagem/

My housemate has just paid 1 grand for a back tattoo and obviously can‚Äôt reach to do washing and lotion for it. She told me it has to be washed and lotioned 3 times a day.

She works late evening shifts and comes home around 12:30-1am. I am a masters student, who wakes up at 7:30am every morning for my commute. I work weekends as well as going to college 5 days a week. I had to tell her that I literally can not be awake until that time to do her back tattoo as I sleep early around 11-11:30pm.

She‚Äôs THEN went on to say that she‚Äôll wake up at 7:30am so that I can do it for her then and she‚Äôll just go back to sleep after üòÄ 

I think what annoys me the most is basically just that she failed college, only works 3 days a week and she gets a 1 grand tattoo paid by her parents. Like what? ",/r/badroommates/comments/1frqoyv/housemate_is_annoyed_that_i_cant_wash_and_lotion/

1685,Going Pro in Pickleball,"Pickleball post


My coworker‚Äôs kid is actually trying to go pro in pickleball, so a few days ago (after their blog came out) I grilled her about the process and have come to the conclusion that Paul will never go pro. Not in six months. Not in this timeline. 

Firstly, going pro in pickleball is hard, but not impossible. I believe you‚Äôre considered to be pro if you win a certain amount of money (which is probably what Porgan is hoping for), but Coworker‚Äôs Kid (CK) said that the ‚Äòeasiest‚Äô way they‚Äôve been told to do it is to get a sponsorship. Basically, you grind like crazy, win local tournaments, travel to out-of-state tournaments as often as possible, and win as often as you can in every category. If a ponsors see you as being worthwhile, they may want to pick you up. 

Pickleball is a super expensive sport, and unless you have a ton of money to throw at it, getting someone to sponsor you is the best way. CK just got sponsored a few months ago. Basically they‚Äôll cover travel and tournament fees and match what they win up to a certain amount. Once they maxes the yearly allowance, anything else is up to them to pay. CK is hoping that next year they‚Äôll be offered to be on the sponsor‚Äôs team. If they get on the team, they‚Äôll actually get a yearly salary in addition to all the perks I listed above. The salary is good (around 45-50K) but you‚Äôre not going to be swimming in pools of solid gold unless you win huge tournaments and lots of money. 

CK is now 18 and has been seriously playing pickleball since the pandemic. CK practices for hours every day, makes super healthy food, stretches and works out, travels to tournaments at least once or twice a month, and is generally very dedicated to the sport. 

Basically, do we see Paul grinding like crazy to MAYBE get a sponsorship? Because I don‚Äôt. I see him praying to go to win huge tournaments and making a shocked Pikachu face when he doesn‚Äôt. ",/r/FundieSnarkUncensored/comments/1fri7xk/going_pro_in_pickleball/

Some folks goes as far as to say Spanish sources mocked the Japanese for their poor swordsmanship skills. 

The closest thing I know of Spanish soldiers facing off against Japanese samurai or Wako pirates is the 1582 Cagayan battles. But I don't know much about the battles besides Spain managing to repell a large pirate attack.

And what makes it worse is that we know he's had issues in the past with taking flights, which is why we had RoboScar during the last Hermitcraft Charity Livestream.

These airlines really need to focus on improving...well, a lot, as we've been seeing in the news lately, but treating passengers with disabilities better is up there, too. I heard there's a very real risk of flight attendants damaging or even breaking wheelchairs on flights. Those suckers are expensive, especially motorized ones! It's crazy that that's just a fact of life and something passengers with disabilities have to deal with, without any financial compensation to pay for the wheelchair.

I'm trying to keep it positive, though. If anything, I should be glad that's the only thing Scar went through this trip. No concussion, no broken wheelchair, no being left on the plane well after everyone else has cleared out, etc.",/r/HermitCraft/comments/1frfxlz/goodtimeswithscar_vs_tsa_lady/

The young lad came in and said lets do a toss/rock paper scissors for who gets which room. And we can even do a 6 month switch if both agree.

Somewhere deep down it invoked the young me to spring up and said lets do it. Made me miss how easygoing, simple and accomodating we were in youth.

Two and half months ago we found out she had kidney cancer in both her kidneys. If it was just one we could have removed it, but being in both was worst case. I didn‚Äôt want to put her through all these surgeries when she was already older and weak, she‚Äôs already had medical problems in the past. 
So I took her home on hospice. I was suppose to put her down Monday, I could tell she was reaching the end but in literally 12 hours, overnight she took a turn for the worst. She became a rag doll. Couldn‚Äôt hold her head up, couldnt stand because she‚Äôd collapse, she‚Äôd barely move. So I made the call to put her down Friday instead. Which killed me because I had a whole weekend planned for her but I couldn‚Äôt do it.
The night before I put her down, she used all of her energy to climb up my stairs and to my room, she looked terrible but im glad I got to spend one more night cuddling with her. 
Anyways, putting her down was really rough. I feel guilty but I know it was for the best. I keep thinking about what ifs and I keep thinking about how scarred she must have been in her final moments. I was with her for all of it, when they put her down, but I wish I knew she was comforted and ok.

1971,Driving while using the phone,"Today while waiting at a stoplight I got ""bumped"" on the back of my car, and the worst part is that I clearly saw it coming through my rearview mirror. The driver was looking down at their cell phone instead of the road.

Fortunately nothing happened to my car nor theirs, but I was a bit upset and I did say to them: ""It could've been a lot worse. Please keep your eyes on the road."" They got offended and drove off mad, as if I had struck a nerve.

It's incredible how many times I've caught drivers of all ages impatiently looking down to their phones while driving, even on the 417. Is it really that important to be visually tethered to the damn phone? I'm sure calls and messages can wait, and these days with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay you can pretty much dictate to your phone through the car's entertainment system. If you don't know how to do this, please learn or otherwise just put your phone aside and focus on driving only!

2027,Moral Puritanism and the Body Keeps the Score,"I have about 50 pages left in Bessel Van Der Kolk's beloved and controversial text *the Body Keeps the Score*. I feel like I've learned so much about how the brain functions and I've even gained some practical knowledge for the management of my own ADHD (neurofeedback here I come).

When I came to Reddit to read discussions about the book, I wasn't surprised to find criticism. I was surprised, though, by how many people read the first chapter (which contains triggering content about the Vietnam war) and stopped reading there. These folks decided that Van Der Kolk must be morally reprehensible because he expressed empathy for an American veteran who admitted to committing war crimes. I scrolled through endless comments that essentially said, ""murderers and rapists don't deserve empathy or therapy, they deserve to feel guilty forever or die.""

In no way does the book advocate or support war crimes, murder, rape, or abuse of any kind. It does acknowledge the fact that trauma compounds and causes *more* trauma in an ever expanding web. The veteran discussed in the first chapter watches his unit die around him, takes revenge in the worst possible way, and then brings all of that rancor home with him, where it begins to affect his innocent wife and child. 

How can we ever hope to resolve the circumstances that cause atrocities without ever examining them directly? What good does pushing it away do? 

I'll admit that at times Van Der Kolk's language isn't exactly to my taste, but when one places him in his context (a professional white man who has been considered a leading expert in his field for decades) the vaguely chauvinistic tendencies in his writing make sense.

Is our collective reading comprehension really this low, or is it just that the content is potentially quite triggering and people make snap judgements based upon their own trauma rising to the surface?

(Having read *the Body Keeps the Score*, I'm leaning towards the latter).

I'm guess I'm concerned about what seems like a societal predisposition towards silencing/dismissing any content that doesn't fit inside an easy-to-digest, morally uncomplicated box. Van Der Kolk has gone on record saying that this book was intended for clinicians, so it may be an extreme example with a mismatched audience, but I've seen this modern Puritanism in plenty of other spaces too.

I'd love to read your thoughts. I've previously discussed this at length in fanfiction spaces, but I'd love to hear some discourse about published works as well. ",/r/books/comments/1frfkel/moral_puritanism_and_the_body_keeps_the_score/

But tonight I‚Äôm shattered wide open &amp; stuck &amp; frozen In the process of reliving the 24 hours leading up to the worst days of my life. 

On Sunday, 29th it‚Äôll be exactly 5 months since my soulmate &amp; amazing husband died by suicide &amp; I found him.. just 1 days before we celebrated or were supposed to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. So crazy how that day last year was one of the most joyous of my life‚Ä¶ fast forward a year &amp; I was sitting at the funeral home making arrangements I didn‚Äôt think I would have to for several decades or not at all‚Ä¶ 
I was also so triggered &amp; angry &amp; hopeless cause exactly 16 months prior..  I was sitting in that funeral home holding my husbands hand as we picked out a casket for our baby boy. Yeah, Sunday it‚Äôll be 21 months since our baby boy died. When we did, we knew we wanted the plot next to him, &amp; we chose a double depth spot. One casket on bottom, one on top. Talk of death was normal now when your child is gone, &amp; the cemetery was our safe place &amp; comfort, not only cause our baby boy was at rest there, but it‚Äôs where as partners we carried one another through the hardest moments of our lives, our pain, our despair, our love‚Ä¶ &amp; did it together. 

Now.. it‚Äôs just me. I know you‚Äôre both spiritually with me always.. but idc, reliving those moments, coming to terms with the finality fucking hurts, but having to realize &amp; accdpt this is my reality no matter how much I don‚Äôt like it, &amp; for so many of us.. is just soul shattering. Fuck. Babies shouldn‚Äôt die. Kids shouldn‚Äôt have to be buried by their parents. I know death is natural &amp; it still hurts even in old age‚Ä¶ but for me &amp; the others in their 20‚Äôs, we should be enjoying life &amp; making memories with our partner &amp; little family &amp; experiencing so many beautiful firsts‚Ä¶ not heartbreaking first &amp; lasts. Everyone who has had to bd widowed period, my heart goes out to you. But people in their 20‚Äôs / 30‚Äôs / 40‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be planning their partners funeral, should be planning family vacations &amp; vows renewals. Our partners should have gotten the chance to live a long life‚Ä¶ &amp; turn old &amp; grey with us. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is just super negative &amp; down &amp; sad. If you read all this, you‚Äôre a Champ. Even if no one does, I‚Äôve always been a writer &amp; had to just get this shit out some way ‚Ä¶ some how. Thanks for giving me that outlet &amp; safe space to do so. Don‚Äôt mind my mini photo dump too, my beautiful boys resting spot, mine &amp; my husbands joint crypt is still being paid off‚Ä¶ &amp; I enjoy decorating it all cute &amp; pretty for them &amp; making fresh bouquets &amp; just laying with them &amp; hanging out. Makes me feel a sense of worth &amp; like I‚Äôm still taking care of them.

2036,"I made the mistake of asking for a ""glass"" of Guinness in Dublin","A few years ago, I was in the main airport in Dublin, Ireland, waiting to board a flight to Germany.

Being that I was in Dublin, I thought I'd get a Guinness since I like dark beer and Ireland was definitely the right place for it. 

I wandered around the airport for a little while before I found a bar. 

I had just flown in from California, so my brain was a little discombobulated, but I knew I **had** to get a Guinness before I left Ireland.

So, I walked up to the bartender and prepared to ask for a Guinness. However, in my jet- lagged state, what came out of my mouth was, ""Hello. A glass of Guinness, please.""

The look on the bartender's face said, ""the fuck did this dumb American just say?""

So, he grabs a wine glass, holds it up to me, and says, ""A glass of Guinness. You mean this?""

It suddenly dawned on me that I had messed up one of the simplest things in the world, which is ordering a **pint** of Guinness. With that in mind, I stammered out the correct order, paid for it, and sheepishly drank my Guinness as fast as I could.

He doesn't look like any other Goblin introduced at the moment, it looks like some kind of doctor (Reminds me of Dr Willy from MegaMan) and maybe he will haven electric powers (I mean, it's an electric themed season so it fits). We still have one Champion left from the Goblin Queen Journey announcement so I think this may be the champion they mentioned.

The biggest challenge for me was that I couldn‚Äôt find any pics of the front. I researched her other gowns for design inspiration. I‚Äôm posting the extant gown next to my design sketch. 

The dress is silk taffeta lined with voile, trimmed with lace and heavily beaded. I really love the draped sash, but I could never get it to lay right and at the last minute decided to cut it asymmetrically and bead the cut edges.

The only differences are that Superman has powers and Batman doesn‚Äôt, and Superman does his heroics in broad daylight for everyone to see and praise him cuz he‚Äôs all smiles 9 times out of 10, plus people see him as some sort of All American crime fighter which makes sense since he‚Äôs wearing America‚Äôs colors, which is why some people call him the Big Blue Boy Scout 

Batman does his heroics in the shadows at night only being praised by the people he saves and the GCPD, instead of being praised by the whole city everytime he shows up and since he wears dark colors he‚Äôs called the Dark Knight, not to mention that he wears a mask and never smiles as opposed to Superman who shows his face and grins from ear to ear

2094,Garage transformation at my last house ,"A couple weeks ago, I posted pics of my garage transformation at my current home which got a lot of love and attention that I did not expect. Thanks for that!

This posts shows the garage transformation at my old house; it's not quite as nice but also pretty cool in my opinion. I didn't get to fully complete it as I had to move and sell the house due to a new job.

Now to go over some of the details:
This garage was also a triple car but slightly larger than my current one at 36' X 24' with 12 and 15.5 ft ceilings.

It has insulated concrete forms so the footings jutted out quite a ways. I did not want to do a build out and waste space so after doing a lot of research, I decided to go with powdercoated wood cabinets made by Redline Garage Gear. These cabinets don't have a back and mount on a rail system, using the wall as your backing. They sit off the floor and I was able to notch out the bottoms of the cabinet so I could have it flush to the walls and not have to waste space using conventional metal cabinets.

I also got a 84"" matching Redline workbench on Casters I put up against a small wall besides the stairs as that wall was only 87"" long. This is also where I hung up the TV and was able to utilize the space effectively.
I really wanted Hayley Cabinets like I have at my current place but it just didn't make sense with the large footings.
Redline makes awesome cabinets as well, quality wise they're excellent but not quite as good as Hayley.

These floors were also polyaspartic (I paid to have them done by pros) and they took a bit of a beating. I rebuilt two motorcycles, a car and did some reno work in the house where I had everything set up in the garage. I trimmed out the footings using gray tin (what an absolute pain in the ass this was)!

I used proslat for the cabinet backsplash and along the walls. Used dark gray along one side and then white along the other. Proslat and their hooks/shelving system is awesome to keep stuff off the floors and onto the walls.

This garage did have hot and cold water taps but no drain so I couldn't put in a sink. The garage floor itself did have two drains though so washing the floors was a breeze.

The ceilings were taller in this one (12 feet) and near the back of the garage they were even taller (15.5 ft) so I decided to build a floating mezzanine for storage. I was going to paint or trim it out but by then I knew I was going to be moving so unfortunately it remained bare.

Like an idiot, I took very few pics of the completed setup so some of the ""complete"" pics have random stuff on the floor; and dont have any with the automatic hose reel installed. I snapped up pics as I was moving.

I didn't get to put side mount garage door openers and high door lifts in this one. This garage also didn't have a car lift. 
I used aluminum checker plating to trim out some spots, give it a garage vibe.
I did have to change out the clear garage doors as they had no insulation to R-18 rated doors.

Overall, this transformation happened over 16 months. I loved this garage as well, didn't quite get to complete it the way I wanted but it saw a lot of projects and took a beating.
Hope you like it as much as I did..

One other thing to note - when we put the house up for sale, I decided to add the cost of the build to the price and was able to recoup the money. My realtor said the people that bought the house loved the garage and it was one of the main reasons they chose this house over the others they had narrowed down.

Thanks for looking, cheers!",/r/garageporn/comments/1frg9ab/garage_transformation_at_my_last_house/

2153,The problem with Origins mattering mechanically,"I'm going to describe to you a character. 

A veteran battlemage, who has experience fighting with magic in a war, now making a living as an adventurer. They're skilled in tactics, have a good understanding of what their role is in a fight, and can act as a levelheaded, experienced strategist for the team. A wizard with some real life experience behind them, who honed their magic not in an ivory tower, but on the battlefield. An intellectual who's knowledge is practical, not simply book learning.

Now, in 5e 2014, this is a perfectly good character! There's a pretty wide variety of races you can use, so there's plenty of room to iterate on this concept. Sure, you could argue that one race is better than another, but if you're getting +1 int, then your ability to fulfill that class fantasy of the skilled, experienced battlemage will be just fine.

In dnd 2024, Picking the Soldier origin for a Wizard is basically throwing. You get a feat that is completely useless to you, and your stat bonuses? No int bonus is rough.

You see the issue here? Having such a thing as ""mechanically optimal backstories"" restricts creativity in terms of what kind of characters can be made far more than ""mechanically optimal species"". And sure! You can argue that maybe neither should be optimal in this way. I'm just stressing the fact that this? It's not an improvement.

Sure, maybe your characters could be all different kinds of races now, but their backstories are going to feel far more samey, if you're being strict on Origin rules.",/r/dndnext/comments/1frjtb0/the_problem_with_origins_mattering_mechanically/

2197,Israel is rewriting a book on modern warfare,"Say what you will about Israel, but they truly rewriting the book on modern warfare. They literally teach how to win against overwhelming amount of enemies from all sides. 

I'm not talking about their internal politics, but instead about their covert ops and military campaigns. 

Starting from 10/07/2023, Israel had been engaged at war with Hamas, that murdered 1139 people (815 civilians) and kidnapped an additional 251 hostages. It's a pure nightmare for a military to engage a war with terrorists that hide among civilians. The result speaks for itself. Almost all of the terrorist leadership is gone and their military potential is all but dismantled. Especially  impressive the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas at Teheran. That was just the taste of the things to come. 

Hezbollah, a huge terrorist organization and Iran' proxy, that in fact taken control of Lebanon and merged itself with the local politics, had been a threat to Israel' existence since its foundation at 1982, had been bombing Northen part of Israel for the past YEAR!!! (no less). They weren't deterred even by US warnings. Finally, Israel had decided to take matters into their own hands. 

Operation Pagers. It's hard to imagine the true extent of this operation. Setting up fake companies and selling huge amounts of compromised pagers and radios directly to Hezbollah, is nothing short of an art of espionage at this level. Blowing them all up simultaneously, thus crippling most of the communication within the organization and taking out most of the operatives is something from the 007 movies. 

Within two weeks time!!! Israel had wiped out entire leadership (and their replacements) of the terrorist organization, including their legendary leader Hassan Nassralla. Additionally dismantling (blowing up) their rockets arsenal. This is the way the wars are won. Not only Israel had taken two major radical Islam groups out of commission, it had literally crippled Iran of their military influence on the region. They are beaten without any shred a doubt. That is an art of modern warfare and I hope that western countries take notes. That's simply incredible. 

Compared to Russia\\Ukraine war, that literally teaches us how not to engage wars, Israel had shown us a pure masterclass.

2214,The amount of grown men I have to block is staggering,"I was a part of a group on Facebook that had close to 250,000 members in it. I found that men would comment unnecessary and vile shit just when someone was looking for advice. Wild considering that that is the point of the community.  
An older woman would make a post asking for help about X topic, and the amount of grown men that would call her ""moron"" ""Karen"" or say things like ""You shouldn't be here if you can't navigate Google"" was downright depressing.   
To combat this, I started my own, private group on the same topic (I'm being vague here on purpose) to help people feel like they can come ask questions no matter their skill level and feel comfortable. 

The amount of grown men that are offended by this gesture is absolutely WILD. I am torn apart in the comments, called a snowflake, cursed at, called Karen.   
In the group itself, which I mentioned is private, I've been pretty good at sifting through people that don't belong, they don't fill out the questions, or their profile looks suspect. But several still slip through, and if they don't they try and send me DMS, and my GOD. Imagine being an adult that is so wildly offended that other adults want a place to go where you aren't able to actively bully someone. 

I think my favorite insult so far was just someone calling me a snowflake that needed a safe space. Like no, this isn't meant to be a saccharine ass-kissing fest it's literally just the bare minimum of being kind and polite to someone.

2220,240-&gt;182lbs - Progress 1 year ,"https://imgur.com/a/e6PMx4M

Marked NSFW, 2 shirtless pictures

Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve posted here before, but since my last post I‚Äôve lost another 15 pounds. I‚Äôm at the point where I no longer want to lose weight. Finally üéâ . If I can do it, you guys can too! I believe in you all. 


I initially started this weight loss journey because of my hypothyroidism. I had a TSH of 7 before I started my weight loss journey and to my surprise now at the very end my TSH is 9. I thought it would be impossible to lose weight because of my slow metabolism but it‚Äôs totally possible. I encourage everyone with hypo to be positive and give it their all. 

How I did it:
-1800-2000 cal/day (~2700-3000 maintenance now probably 2500)
-30 minutes of stair stepper 3x a week
-30 min-1hr of incline treadmill walking everyday
-Weight training

I didn‚Äôt track any of my calories with an app, I just did it mentally. For me it was super important to know I could cheat every so often as long as my long term average caloric intake was below 2100 or so. 

I really encourage everyone to eat what they enjoy and just try to be healthy about it. Really understanding how you‚Äôre getting your calories helped me the most. I used to drink a monster everyday and maybe soda too and it added up to over 500 calories, then on top of that eating too much. Diet Coke and coffee carried my cut. 

If I was ever hungry, my suggestion is to get a snack like apples or cherry tomatoes. Those were my favorites. 

Good luck everybody ",/r/loseit/comments/1frq7j6/240182lbs_progress_1_year/

I'd be making a sandwich, offer to make him one, he'd decline and then ask me for a bite and eat most of it.  I'd end up making another.  Sandwich, bowl of ice cream, didn't matter.  He'd reach across the table and take food off my plate.  It was annoying as hell.  

One night I was making popcorn and offered to make him some.  ""Nope, I'm good""  I knew what was going to happen.  I put a ton of cayenne pepper all over it.  I love hot food so it was no skin off my teeth.  Sure as shit, he plunges his hand into the bowl, as soon as I sit down and throws a big handful into his mouth.  He started to cough, his face turned beet red, tears ran down his face.  He could barely speak.  I started to laugh.  It was the gift that kept on giving.  He rubbed the tears from his eyes, the snot from his nose and then moaned in pain.  He raced to the bathroom to rinse out his eyes and wash his face and hands.  He looked like a drown rat with a cold when he came out.  

I held up the bowl to him and said, ""Want some more?""

Osim par na pocetku 20ih gde su se meni bliski ljudi uzimali i pravili svadbe da se proslave, bukvalno za svaku sada cujem da su mladenci prokomentarisali koliko su zaradili i to im je bar 50 posto razloga zasto prave svadbu.

Ljudi za koje sam mislio da su dovoljno zdravi u glavu, zapisuju u svesku koliko im je ko dao, sve se prica i komentarise, svi su puni tastine kako se ko obukao i ko se kako ponasao.

Ceo cirkus koji vise lici na film Emira Kusturice, iako bi se pre obradovao da me neki Rom pozove na svadbu da se stvarno proveselim.

Prvi rodjendani i krstenja sa po 100 ljudi, za ljude koji ne znaju ni kad se posti, niti poznaju svoje svestenike.

  
Bukvalno mi se sjebe raspolozenje kada dobijem pozivnicu, jer se osecam kao budala, jos mi otkine taj vikend i unese stres od devojke sta ce obuci, kada stici da se sve lepo nakiti i ko ce sutradan ustati jer svi uzimaju nedelju jer im je jeftinije.",/r/serbia/comments/1frlkdm/nepopularno_misljenje_zgadile_su_mi_se_svadbe_i/

2341,‚ÄúThe revolution won‚Äôt be televised; it will be memed.‚Äù ‚Äî Brock Pierce,"Welcome to the epicenter of a meme coin revolution that bridges decentralized finance and meme culture. The $ANUS token isn‚Äôt just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a Super Meme designed to reshape the future of liquidity and digital assets. With a community-driven takeover, $ANUS is building a bridge that connects memecoins, NFTs, and Bitcoin‚Äîthe ultimate store of value. As Elon Musk famously said, ‚ÄúWhoever controls the memes, controls the universe.‚Äù And $ANUS is set to do just that.



**What Makes $ANUS Different?**



 1. Black Hole of Liquidity (Launching Soon):

Prepare for a gravity-defying technology that will make $ANUS the liquidity hub for meme coins and NFTs. Our Black Hole tech will create a powerful bridge, making it effortless for projects to access Bitcoin‚Äôs value and stability, just as Tether transformed liquidity in the broader market.

 2. Super Meme Status: The Ultimate Bridge for Digital Assets:

By morphing into a Super Meme, $ANUS is more than just a token. It‚Äôs the first meme coin to integrate real-world liquidity solutions, allowing memecoins and NFTs to anchor to the ultimate store of value: Bitcoin.

 3. RocketFuel Contracts: Stake Your Claim:

Fuel our mission to Uranus by locking in your $ANUS tokens and earning exclusive staking rewards. RocketFuel Contracts will support the project‚Äôs growth while rewarding the community.

 4. Snapshot Milestones: Align with Cosmic Forces:

Our carefully timed snapshots align with key lunar phases, rewarding loyal holders with NFTs and staking bonuses that symbolize our shared journey to becoming the ultimate Super Meme.

 5. Ecosystem Expansion: Building a Super Meme Network:

We‚Äôre actively partnering with tech innovators, community leaders, and influencers to expand the $ANUS ecosystem. These partnerships will increase visibility and bring tangible value to our holders.



**What‚Äôs on the Horizon?**



As we grow, $ANUS will evolve from a memecoin to a fully-fledged platform that provides liquidity and utility for digital assets. Our community-driven roadmap ensures that every step forward is aligned with our vision of becoming the bridge between meme culture and decentralized finance. With each new innovation, $ANUS will cement its status as the gravitational center of the meme coin universe.



**Join the Revolution:**

Are you ready to be part of the $ANUS gravitational pull? As we continue our journey to Uranus, we invite you to join a community-driven movement that is transforming the future of finance, one meme at a time. This is more than a token‚Äîit‚Äôs a revolution.

2350,Sacramento: Fury Road,"Instead of being mad about it, I‚Äôve chosen to fully embrace the unique, one of a kind experience of driving in Sacramento!

It‚Äôs like being in a Mad Max movie. Before buckling my seatbelt I tell my wife ‚ÄúWitness!‚Äù and spray some of her propolis into my mouth. She looks at me all puzzled (she refuses to watch any Mad Max movie) 

Then on the freeway the real fun begins. 50 is like the wasteland - always changing, it‚Äôs like a procedurally generated driving apocalypse! Will there be random construction today? Will they randomly add a new lane? Or close one for no reason?? Those Caltrans boyz need a job to do and they‚Äôre gonna have one no matter what! 

The pickup trucks randomly veering into your lane and not caring about it! They‚Äôre from Gastown (Rancho Cordova). The Benzes and BMW‚Äôs going a little too fast - you dont have to worry about them cause they dont wanna get their cars wrecked.

What you REALLY gotta watch out for are the lil piece of shit tricked out hondas and subarus. The next level of these guys might not even have bumpers (ominous!) These guys (always guys with a somewhat weird haircut) will try to beat you in a merge at all times, try to cut in front of you for who knows why, and weave in and out of lanes with no regards for safety or logic. I yell ‚ÄúMediocre!‚Äù And my wife looks at me like I‚Äôve lost it in this early fall 100 degree weather.

Just like a good movie, gotta watch out for those plot twists! You think you‚Äôre out of the wasteland, on the side streets, but this is where it gets REALLY hairy - watch out for the red light runners! These smooth brain, drooling, ‚Äúhow do magnets work?‚Äù type ‚Äòpeople‚Äô can‚Äôt let themselves be assed to stop at a red light cause Yolo! Or they might be turtlin‚Äô idek at this point.

Anyway we get to our destination, I gracefully, heroically fade into the horizon, my wife shrugging as she pays $7 for an hour of parking as we head to get some overpriced coffee.

2354,Late game tech makes pumps obsolete in 2.0,"This is a story of the virgin fluid pump vs the chad fluid barrel

With pumps limited to 1200u/s in 2.0 and fluid systems limited to 250x250 tiles, there is a need to rethink long-distance fluid transport, with fluid wagons playing a bigger role and fluid barrels getting another look.

With the new green high-speed belts and the new stack inserters in 2.0, you can belt up to 240 items/second. With 50 fluid units in each barrel, that is 12,000 fluid/second on a green belt.   

Fluid wagons now have the best throughput for long-distance fluid hauling, but once in your base, putting it in barrels can move more fluid over medium distance and pipes and pumps are relegated to short-distance duty to move fluids within your production set ups and power generators. 

Your nuclear power set-up can now take water barrels off of green belts that your assembly machine 3's empty into your heat exchangers

The first weeks was the honeymoon face as it is with all new subclasses launching. But ever since builds have been established everything else feels completely lack luster in terms of ad clearing, healing and dmg resistance.

Now I‚Äôve even unlocked the broken class items like calibans+syntho for hunter, and inmost+syntho for titan. And warlocks always had getaway. And oh boy does this game feel free.

So my worry is, the guardians power has been powercreeped out of this world to the point like I feel like I‚Äôm playing an easier version of the game. Everything I touch gets obliterated in seconds. I hope bungie increases difficulty to balance this out (the new bane system seems promising). But what do they do about the other classes? Powercreep them too? Or nerf Prismatic into the ground? It feels like there‚Äôs is no good solution to the problem prismatic has introduced. I‚Äôm honestly ok being stuck on Prismatic for now but that will get stale eventually.

At 1:00:37, Tomer says that the RC has polled CAG multiple times on a constant basis. Apparently the overwhelming majority of CAG consistently said fast mana is problematic for the game. The RC just didn‚Äôt directly ask about cards. The podcast still says the overall communication is problematic. 

I think this is important, there was input. 

Every major content creator, including the Command Zone and Tolarian CC, has said the format is likely more fun without JLo/Dockside/Crypt. In fact they even ban those cards for their own videos. The only concern is for the people heavily ‚Äúinvested‚Äù in those cards. 

Based purely on gameplay this was the consensus right move. The RC should only care about the format health.

2444,"Ma‚Äôam, you‚Äôre going to regret pushing for an answer to your question.","About 15 years ago I was having a lot of back pain. After a few rounds of physical therapy and such, I was sent to a pain specialist. After looking over all my tests, imaging, etc he decided the best course of action would be an injection of cortisone in my spine. (Also how I learned I was allergic to cortisone!) 

I had to request time off for the procedure, which was set up for a Monday since that‚Äôs our slowest day. Thursday during my shift there‚Äôs an announcement over the PA- ‚ÄúClara, you have an important call on line 3. Clara, line 3.‚Äù Now in my family/friends, you don‚Äôt call people at work unless there is serious injury, illness or death. So my adrenaline immediately shot up. Our store was also still set up with corded phones, none of them long enough to reach anywhere private. 

So I grab the phone furthest from the counter and answer. Nurse ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù immediately starts speaking to me in a tone usually reserved for puppies that peed in the house. ‚ÄúWe have you down for an appointment Monday, and the doctor will be using an X-ray to guide the needle. No one had you take a pregnancy test, so we need you to come in today before 4 to take one, and you‚Äôll have to pay $35 for it to be expedited.‚Äù

I was silent for at least a minute. First, I marked my work number as emergencies only. Secondly, THEY did not ask me to take the test, yet her tone would indicate I made that decision. I was also working until 9pm that day. And as for an extra fee, well‚Ä¶

But I‚Äôm at work, so I‚Äôm trying to stay in ‚Äúprofessional voice.‚Äù (Also, when I‚Äôm irritated, the Southern accent I got from my daddy sneaks out a little, and all my coworkers know this)

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I will not be coming in today for any kind of testing. I‚Äôm scheduled to work until 9 and-‚Äú

NK (Nurse Karen) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you heard me young lady! You WILL be here before 4 so we can get the results in time.‚Äù

Me (as if she didn‚Äôt say a word) ‚Äúand I‚Äôm working the late shift tomorrow as well, so that is not an option. I‚Äôm not responsible for your staff not having me do the test while I was there.‚Äù (She tried to break in but I kept talking, a little louder than I would have preferred.) ‚ÄúEven if I were able to take a test, there is absolutely no way I would be paying any sort of fee because y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt have your paperwork in order.‚Äù

The ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù alerted my coworkers (most of whom had nothing to do so were happy for entertainment) that whatever was happening was going downhill fast. 

NK ‚ÄúListen missy (for the record, I was nearly 30 when this happened) we have already addressed the situation with the staff. But you need to get down here right now. Tell your work it‚Äôs a medical emergency.‚Äù

Me ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam I can understand your frustration in dealing with people who don‚Äôt understand their job. I can understand why you need the test results, and when I come in on Monday I will happily sign any waivers you need. I am not lying to my boss and attempting to get to your office in 20 minutes, since it‚Äôs rush hour on this end of town.‚Äù Now I can count on one hand how many times in the 5+ years I worked there my boss was still there that close to 4, but of course that day was one of them. So she just heard ‚Äúlying to my boss‚Äù and her head snapped around like it was guided by an antenna dish. Now literally every employee in my area is watching (and listening) to me. 

NK ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get down here before we close, we will have to cancel your procedure, and he probably won‚Äôt have another opening until January of next year.‚Äù

I do not take being lied to well. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, when I was there last Friday the scheduler showed me the book because of my unpredictable work schedule. So you either just lied to me, or there was a sudden influx of patients in less than a business week because I pretty much had my pick of the day for several weeks out. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a manager of some sort or someone would have taken the phone away from you by now. You are not canceling my appointment. I do not need a test. I will sign a waiver.‚Äù

NK ‚ÄúYou HAVE to take a pregnancy test!‚Äù (She had correctly gathered that I was about to go over her head; I truly don‚Äôt know why she was still on the phone. I had a friend that worked in the same building that said they had people sign waivers all the time as long as it was explained what could happen if the patient was pregnant and they still didn‚Äôt want the test.)

Me ‚ÄúNo I do not. I will sign whatever you need 
me to sign, but I can tell you for certain that the test is not necessary.‚Äù

NK ‚ÄúWell you might not think you‚Äôre pregnant, but a lot of girls just don‚Äôt understand the symptoms in the early stages and so we have to make sure you don‚Äôt hurt yourself or the baby-‚Äú

AND professional (as well as my general reluctance to speak about my private life at work) went out the window. Also, this was around 2010. 

Me ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, the last time I had sex there was a 19 in front of the year. So unless we‚Äôre in an immaculate conception situation, I am completely certain that I am not pregnant and there is no baby!‚Äù (At this point ALL my coworkers, even the ones that didn‚Äôt like me, burst out laughing so hard they had to lean on furniture. My best work friend fell on the floor in the fetal position, red faced, laughing so hard no noise was coming out. I was NOT laughing, I was angry. 

Nurse Karen was silent for several seconds, then I heard papers being shuffled around.

NK ‚ÄúUmm okay. We‚Äôll just have you sign the waiver on Monday. Please remember to bring someone with you to drive you home. I‚Ä¶ I apologize for any mixup.‚Äù Then she hung up on me. 

Unsurprisingly, she wasn‚Äôt in the office on Monday. She didn‚Äôt get fired (I asked my friend about it) but the call had been recorded for teaching purposes on how to handle it if there was a mixup and a patient needed to come back for another test before their procedure.

2463,I was a crappy customer to our crappy customer,"I used to work a customer service job at a dispensary. We had this one customer who was just a cranky, miserable woman. She'd come in acting all sweet, say hi to us all, ask for her product, and then the show would begin. Here's an example of how these transactions typically went:

""This isn't what I ordered, go get what I ordered!""
Employee-""Ma'am, you specifically requested this 8th. You said you wanted 3.5 grams of brownie scout""
""No, I said I wanted the pineapple gummies! Go get them now!"" 
We would go get the thing she said she wanted, she'd complain about lazy employees, be all smiles again, and then she would pay and leave...... 

and be right back in the store a half hour later with any excuse she could think of. The package was opened when she got it, the edibles melted together. There was a hair in her jar, the packaging smelled like chlorine. Any stupid excuse she could pull from her ass looking for a refund or store credit, she would try and use it. Every single time she came in this is how it went. 

But then one day, I went to a gas station to fill up my car while i was in the next town over, and wouldn't you be damned, she was a cashier at the gas station. So I of course asked for a pack of marlboro 100s. She grabbed the pack and I said ""that's not what I asked for. I asked for the camels"" she grabbed the camels. ""Um, that's not what I wanted. I wanted the newports"" she sighed and grabbed the Newports. ""What are you doing? I'm just in here to pay for my gas"" the long stare she gave me was almost enough to make me regret starting shit, but she knew as an employee she could get in real trouble if she snapped. So she forced a smile, put my cash in the register, and I went on my merry way. 

But I wasn't done. I came right back in 5 minutes later. I looked at her and said ""excuse me, I only spent x amount on gas, but you took all of my money. Where's my change??"" She is obviously super pissed off at this point, but what was she gonna do about it? That's fucking right, absolutely nothing. So she tries very hard (and fails) to politely explain to me that the gas cost the amount I had given her, and she couldn't give me the difference. So, in a voice that almost sounded exactly like hers, I complained about lazy employees, smiled sweetly, said goodbye, and walked out. Just like she does.

She didn't learn her lesson for a while, came back in a few times with her same ole routine. Then I recruited a coworker, and we both went back to that gas station separately a few times and did our new routine. After trying and failing to file a complaint, she stopped coming in entirely and balance was finally restored. I don't work at the dispensary anymore, but traumatizing her the way she did my coworkers and I still makes me smile years later lol ",/r/ProRevenge/comments/1fr3qcu/i_was_a_crappy_customer_to_our_crappy_customer/

Not Exactly Hidden

  
  


  
  


‚ÄúAndrogynous ass Asians...‚Äù Immeghar mutters and the Koga scoff in unison at him. They don‚Äôt look like themselves. They look like two different secretaries, down to the horns, tails, feminine build and the slight mole that one of them has. It‚Äôs downright surreal.

  
  


‚ÄúWell, it doesn‚Äôt matter how pretty in pink our master ninja are. The only questions are did they get the stuff and did anyone notice?‚Äù Dale asks and then catches the data chip tossed his way. ‚ÄúTechnically not an answer, there could be anything from a local restaurants menu to hardcore Slohb porn on this.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWait, Slohbs are basically just living protoplasm around a hyperdense organ core... they reproduce by budding how would you... why would you...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask questions you don‚Äôt want the answer to.‚Äù Dale says.

  
  


‚ÄúI know the mechanics of how and I know why I just can‚Äôt see it being particularly enjoyable!‚Äù Immeghar states.

  
  


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt knock another man‚Äôs fetishes, it‚Äôs bad form.‚Äù Daiju says still looking like a dainty Apuk woman but forcing his voice down as low as it can go to just add to the surreality of the statement.

  
  


‚ÄúEx-fucking-scuze me? You know what? No. We‚Äôre not going down that path. Both of you get out of your disguises, you both pull off dresses far too well for me to be comfortable with you.‚Äù Immeghar states and there‚Äôs some laughter before Immeghar throws down a smokebomb, and to his relief both other men are dressed ‚Äònormally‚Äô and just look like stereotypical ninjas. With glasses. Because why the hell not?

  
  


‚ÄúAlright, time for the boring part! Aren‚Äôt you looking forward to it!‚Äù One of the two ninja asks in an excited tone and Immeghar immediately pegs that one as the elder. The younger is more responsible unless he‚Äôs already been corrupted.

  
  


‚ÄúRight, now you also...‚Äù Dale begins and they all pause as they hear something through the forest. ‚ÄúWell then...‚Äù

  
  


Both Koga are gone in wood walks. Both Immeghar and Dale quickly change into their own Ninja outfits and follow.

  
  


‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

  
  


‚ÄúAh good you‚Äôre... doubled.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran notes as two Koga arrive. ‚ÄúAh, here with grandfather and...‚Äù

  
  


Two more people dressed identically show up. Except with sunglasses instead of normal glasses and a clearly different size and skin tone on the hands. ‚ÄúAre more to come?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúEventually. You know me, my grandson and these are our apprentices. Any questions?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúSorcerers all?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúTerrifying.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran notes. ‚ÄúSo have you found more than a list of potential troublemakers?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWe suspect that one or more of the investigative organizations that looked into the ills surrounding your family may have been paid off. We‚Äôve just freshly gathered the last decade of reports and financial data from all of them and were about to go over them when you called us.‚Äù Daiju states and Hart‚ÄôGhuran nods.

  
  


‚ÄúGood, if you could help me in instructing my children how to find methods of escape and secret passages? I‚Äôve managed to impart the importance of their survival to them.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYes, and after... they can help us all sift through the files of the organizations we plundered. It IS important to learn how to properly evaluate documents and read through financial data.‚Äù Immeghar offers and both Koga turn to look at him. ‚ÄúIs it a bad idea?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúNo, but a bit much for children.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThen we the adults best not make mistakes. It is a good idea.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran says. ‚ÄúWe must come together after all, and if we are all working towards each other‚Äôs survival then it shall help.‚Äù

  
  


‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

  
  


The training had gone well and they had progressed into getting the kids to help out reading through the files. Which was a struggle as this is a dry topic at the best of times. More than half bow out and start a quiet argument over what to watch on the holo-projector until Dale grabs the remote and puts on a popular movie. Having something actually playing beats out what may be playing and they watch.

  
  


‚ÄúHere we go... look here. Every single one of our suspects received a regular payments from the same source at monthly intervals. It started... the same month you put the bounty on the pirates and continues now. We‚Äôre going to have to check, but I‚Äôm willing to bet that someone saw opportunity and through this company... heh, a shell company literally called Hard Shell Construction, they‚Äôve been paying off all investigators to let them move in your area with ease.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI see it here too.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for continued service in this period and the first is... appropriate discretion.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúSo that makes Hard Shell Construction the next target.‚Äù Daiki notes.

  
  


‚ÄúYou get started on that junior. I‚Äôm going to double and triple check things here, see if anyone let something slip.‚Äù Daiju says and Daiki nods as he rises up.

  
  


‚ÄòWhy the masks?‚Äù One of Hart‚Äôs daughters, Dalla‚ÄôGhuran, asks.

  
  


‚ÄúTradition mostly. But traditions are important, they remind you where you came from.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhere did it start?‚Äù She asks.

  
  


‚ÄúNinjas are about sneaking around and moving without being spotted. This makes us good messengers and spies during wars. Which is why a lot of people liked us. But skin doesn‚Äôt blend in well with shadows or with grass or leaves, so you need to cover it up. That‚Äôs one reason why we have masks.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúOh. Okay. What‚Äôs another?‚Äù Dalla asks.

  
  


‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a mask. If they don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs running around and spying for the other guy then they catch you so easily.‚Äù Dale says before pointing to Immeghar and then Daiju. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs clear that I‚Äôm not him or him, but beyond that do you know anything about me?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúUh... you‚Äôre a man, a sorcerer and not an Apuk?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúAnd since you can‚Äôt check for a sorcerer easily, how do you tell me apart from any non-apuk man in the galaxy?‚Äù Dale asks.

  
  


‚ÄúUhh.... I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù Dale says. ‚ÄúMake sense?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù Dalla‚ÄôGhuran notes in a baffled tone. Considering she‚Äôs barely into her double digits it‚Äôs understandable confusion.

  
  


‚ÄúHmm... well well well this is interesting.‚Äù Daiki‚Äôs voice wafts over from where he‚Äôs researching.

  
  


‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to say it then keep the baited hooks to yourself.‚Äù Immeghar cuts off Daiki who sighs as Daiju chuckles.

  
  


‚ÄúThere are numerous remarks already about Hard Shell Construction being a front or a money laundering operations and several people noting that they never seem to actually construct anything.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhat? That‚Äôs definitely something I need to see. Excuse me.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran says before joining Daiki in his studies. ‚ÄúHmm... not good. I think I will be helping you gentlemen on your next infiltration.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúAs distraction I hope.‚Äù Daiju says.

  
  


‚ÄúCorrect. Although a low profile bodyguard nearby would be useful.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúMe and Dale got that, no problem.‚Äù Immeghar says.

  
  


‚ÄúWell, that seems to be everything then. Why will you be visiting them though?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúSimple, if there are already rumours running around and I want to be seen as a respectable and responsible heir to The Duchy then it behooves me to check won‚Äôt it? Whether there‚Äôs substance to them or not, they‚Äôre going to give me the runaround, but that will put their eyes on me. Leaving you two with the run of the base.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYes, but a Duke showing up with two random Tret looking fools for bodyguards? Kinda suspicious.‚Äù Dale says and Hart‚ÄôGhuran nods before smiling. ‚ÄúThe Barlis?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThe Barlis. They are after all joining the local police force as we speak.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran notes. ‚ÄúWe move tomorrow, that will give The Barlis the prep time they need and time enough to go over what we already have again and find any details that we failed to notice the first time through.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Daiju says. ‚ÄúGrandson, that was not your sign to stop researching earlier, I want to know everything about Hard Shell Construction up to and including their political opinion on coffee being an intoxicant to many species.‚Äù

  
  


‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢√ó‚Ä¢

  
  


Hart‚ÄôGhuran nods as Jayt‚ÄôBarlis and three of her clan members arrive with him. All of them dressed semi-fromally and with openly carried laser rifles and an ornamental, but functional, sword with the crest of the Ghuran strapped to their sides. Time for the show. Dale gets the door as Immeghar holds a briefcase, both are formally dressed, Dale with gloves and a cap, Immeghar with a suit pressed so precisely a laser would be needed to find a crease. Tret driver and lawyer, Apuk bodyguards for public appearance. He is every inch the non-combat Duke.

  
  


Hard Shell Construction‚Äôs main office looks like an area typical to a construction company‚Äôs office. Built into a stripmall and unassuming if not for the numerous large vehicles in the out back parking lot and several motor homes that no doubt serve as mobile offices. Which is why his arriving causes a big splash. One big enough that it completely conceals the shadow slipping in the backdoor and the other checking the containers and mobile offices.

  
  


Two Barlis step through the doorway first and ensure that Hart‚ÄôGhuran is flanked as he walks up to the front desk. His face as stoic as a mountain.

  
  


‚ÄúCan I... can I help you My Lord?‚Äù The fact the receptionist looks ready to run is telling.

  
  


Hart‚ÄôGhuran holds out his left hand and Immeghar opens his briefcase and brings out a device. Hart‚ÄôGhuran activates it and places it on the counter.

  
  


‚ÄúYou are under ducal inspection. There are numerous concerns about your business and it is my business to ensure that the laws in my land are respected if they are not being precisely followed. The concerns about this being a money laundering operation are numerous and varied, leading to my being... concerned.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúOf course My Lord, the head of this office is currently...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúUnoccupied as far as I am concerned. Bring them here.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran orders.

  
  


‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs on her lunch break.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThen recall her, or do I need to have your General Education Diploma redacted as you clearly cheated?‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran threatens and her jaw drops.

  
  


‚ÄúBut that...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúIs within my power. Recall your employer from her lunch break. We need to talk.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran states and she gawks at him. ‚ÄúMust I send you BACK to public education in shame?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúNo sir! I mean My Lord!‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúThen summon her. Now.‚Äù He orders and she picks up a communicator.

  
  


Meanwhile, in the back Daiki slowly edges his way around a vicious looking pet. It‚Äôs some kind of ground bird with a jagged beak he can‚Äôt identify off hand. But it‚Äôs currently napping very lightly and clearly is not to be toyed with. Killing the creature is out of the question and there‚Äôs a detector on the thing‚Äôs neck. Which will likely tell the owner if it‚Äôs been forced to sleep with Axiom.

  
  


A very, very solid and intelligent defence. But... one he‚Äôs still inching his way around. Although inching is probably the wrong word, most people walk at this pace. He can sneak at it.

  
  


While his grandson is dancing his way around the cross between a carnivorous toucan by way of a cassowary, Daiju is slipping into the main office of the leader of Hard Shell Construction and has already guessed the password. Honestly, line of sight passwords are stupid. It only took him two tries to guess that it was her daughters hatchday and name, both of which are clearly marked on the year calendar on the wall.

  
  


What grabs his attention is an email that is signed at the end with the image of a hand drawn symbol. Two diamonds, side by side in a circle. All of it in yellow. The Darv. It also makes numerous references to allies and...

  
  


His hairs stick up and he exits everything and puts it into sleep mode before ducking away and out of sight. A full three seconds later and a woman teleports into the room. Daiju‚Äôs heart is hammering as he mentally congratulates himself for getting to the level of borderline clairvoyance for his reflexes. His ancestors would be proud, if they could find him.

  
  


She leaves the room instantly and he quickly gets back on her computer and copies the evidence, then shuts it off again and follows her out. He was quick, so he actually sees her leave the hallway and enter the main reception.

  
  


Hart‚ÄôGhuran is ready for her. She outright flinches when his gaze shifts to her and she clearly contemplates running despite him having no reputation for battle nor a weapon. The story of what he did to the pirates responsible for the Ghuran massacre and his clearly pissed off but controlled state are enough to put her on edge.

  
  


‚ÄúHello, I am Marl‚ÄôWoor, current head of Hard Shell Construction. What is so important that I‚Äôm going to be working hungry the rest of the day?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYour little organization has been accused, repeatedly and from a wide variety of sources, of being a front and money laundering operation. I am here to ensure that my Duchy is free of such taint.‚Äù

  
  


‚Äú...?! You are investigating me and mine when there are numerous criminals and...‚Äù She stops as his eyes flick to something behind her. It‚Äôs impossible not to notice when his gaze feels like a blade held to the throat. Her heart nearly stops as she‚Äôs suddenly aware of a figure in black directly behind her. His eyes hidden behind glasses that reflect her own fear as he throws a data-chip around her and into the waiting hand of The Duke.

  
  


He plugs it into the small projector on the table and she tries to step away, only for a strong hand on her shoulder to stop her.

  
  


One of the bodyguards leans forward and begins to read it.

  
  


‚ÄúThe following funds are to bribe all known investigative and detective agencies up to and including freelancers and local police in order to keep all reports relating to the following individuals to you first for editing and redaction. The Darv symbol follows and after that is...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúA long and exhaustive list of every branch of the Ghuran family still living in the Duchy.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran says icily. ‚ÄúThis is treachery.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúNo, this is clearly planted my lord! Please! This lunatic has me pinned and...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúContain her in the forest.‚Äù Hart‚ÄôGhuran says. She starts to collapse like a puppet with her strings cut and then vanishes. The receptionist screams before Dale reaches over and grabs her. She fights the Axiom effect, but her focus is broken when vines grow out from under his sleeve to tie her up. She is then knocked out and sent to be right beside Marl‚ÄôWoor in The Dark Forest.

  
  


Hart‚ÄôGhuran takes a deep breath, his Axiom Presence screaming his fury as he outwardly looks calm. Then with only a slight frown he nods to the room. ‚ÄúI want all of them, and I want their secrets in a pretty little row in front of me.‚Äù

  
  


The ninjas move, the Barlis follow and around an unmoving but utterly furious Hart‚ÄôGhuran Hard Shell Construction is looted down to the flooring within the hour.

Anyway, one of the guys that I barely know was there the whole time trying to comfort me, he was lying beside me in my bed, and he started kissing me,
I've been just feeling slightly better,
I had no desire to sleep with him
I've been avoiding dating for a year due to trauma from past
I don't know what happened at that time again I was very sick and I felt like I was dying, I'm not even sure how the whole thing happened, but we ended up having sex

Even at that time, I still couldn't figure out what was happening; I even remember that he asked me If I was asleep cause I couldn't move or open my eyes in the middle of sex.
I regret it very much

I have two other cats so she‚Äôs currently quarantined in my guest bathroom. She‚Äôs painfully skinny but has access to wet food and water and is eating normally and pooped and peed in the litter box I made her. She has some greenish gunk in her eyes that I did my best to clean up yesterday but it‚Äôs back this morning. Also her little nose is runny and wet. Behaviorally, she seems normal though. She is active and cuddly and wants to climb all over me or be in my lap when I‚Äôm in there (I‚Äôm making sure to wash my hands so my other cats don‚Äôt get sick).

My questions are: is the stuff in her eyes an emergent problem or can it wait until Monday? I‚Äôm a full time student rn and money is tight, so if she can safely wait to be seen until normal office hours then I wouldn‚Äôt have to put a huge emergency vet bill on my credit card.

2500,"Husband stabbed, strangled and beat to wife death with hammer in murder suicide","Husband killed wife at Tunbridge Wells home before taking his own life in tragedy

[Source](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/tunbridge-wells/news/husband-killed-ray-of-sunshine-wife-in-murder-suicide-313551/)


A  tree surgeon in financial difficulties strangled, stabbed and hit his wife with a hammer before taking his own life.

Police and paramedics were called to a residential street just after midday on February 23 where they discovered two people dead.

Richard Parks, 63, and ‚Äúray of sunshine‚Äù Suratchanee ‚ÄòLat‚Äô Parks, 53, were found with several injuries inside the first-floor bathroom at their home in Montgomery Road, Tunbridge Wells.

When officers arrived, there was a large pool of blood in the downstairs kitchen and bloodstains on the stairs and in every room of the three-storey house.
Neighbours described the couple as quiet and people who ‚Äúkept themselves to themselves‚Äù, as well as the horrifying screams of a ‚Äúhysterical woman‚Äù after the discovery of the couple.

One woman, who didn‚Äôt want to be named, said: ‚ÄúLat was very sweet and kind. And Richard was always very friendly.

‚ÄúWe never had a problem with them for the two years they were here.‚Äù
Mr Parks, who owned multiple businesses, including a gardening and tree surgeon company, was lying on the floor, with his legs in the hallway, covered in blood. His cause of death was given as stab wounds to the neck.

His wife, who worked at a nail bar and Thai massage parlour, was found in the bath with her legs drawn up, lying in a pool of blood.

Her employer, the London Nail Company which is based at the town‚Äôs Royal Victoria shopping centre, paid tribute to her after the tragic incident.

They posted on social media: ‚ÄúIt is with an extremely heavy heart that we have to announce the passing of our lovely Lat.
‚ÄúWe are all deeply saddened by this loss. Lat was the most gentle, kindest soul, and she will be sorely missed.

We are beyond saddened at this news and our hearts are truly broken. Lat was a little ray of sunshine and she put a smile on many people‚Äôs faces. She will be missed beyond words.‚Äù

Two separate inquests into their deaths were held at Oakwood House in Maidstone on Wednesday.

Pathologist Dr Virginia Fitzpatrick-Swallow said Mrs Parks had suffered neck wounds consistent with being strangled by a hand or arm.
Her torso had been compressed, possibly by Mr Parks sitting on her.
She had deep incisions on her wrists, stab wounds in her neck and had suffered a number of heavy blows to her head, consistent with attacks by a claw hammer which was found near her body. Her skull had been fractured.

She also had other minor injuries which the pathologist said were consistent with defensive wounds as she tried to fight off her attacker.
Some of the injuries - the stab wounds to her neck - had bled little, suggesting they were delivered after she was already dead.

Her husband had also suffered blunt force trauma injuries to his face and nose, most likely from the claw hammer, as well as stab wounds to the neck and abdomen.
He was found with a knife in his right hand.

Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow said that Mr Parks had a pre-existing heart condition that meant his body was unable to fight the injuries he had sustained.
The couple had met in Thailand, where Mrs Parks already had a son, but they moved to the UK.


They were living in rented accommodation, but had recently bought a house in Thailand where they had hoped to retire the following year.
Mrs Parks had no relatives in court, but her son, niece, and other family members joined the inquest by web-link and had the proceedings relayed to them via an interpreter. Mr Parks‚Äôs brother and family were in court.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Jessica Summers said prior to the tragedy, their marriage had been described as ‚Äúhappy and without problems‚Äù.

However, a few weeks earlier, Mr Parks had been presented with a large tax bill from HMRC.
Family members said how he had become very stressed about this and was anxious and pre-occupied and ‚Äústruggling with his mental health‚Äù.

He said the planned move to Thailand was now likely to be delayed because of his financial problems, and his wife had been upset as she had been really looking forward to the move.

She was also concerned that because of their money problems, they were going to have to quit their home and move in with Mr Parks‚Äôs father
On the day of their deaths, relatives had gone to the house, concerned for the couple‚Äôs welfare.

Police attended and found blood stains on the kitchen floor, the dishwasher, the hallway and stairs, and on a sofa and carpet in the living room.

There was blood on a silver metal photo-frame which had been turned facedown. It contained pictures of the couple. A red folder was also found on the hall floor had a large sum of cash in ¬£10 and ¬£20 notes spilling out of it, as well as two coats at the foot of the stairs covered in a large pool of blood.

A blood splatter analyst concluded there had been a bloody assault in the kitchen area and at some time, somebody had moved around the house and had attempted to clean themselves up in the kitchen.

There had also been a heavily bloodstained movement between the kitchen and the bathroom on the first floor.

The pathologist said it was not possible to determine the order of the injuries sustained by Mrs Parks, other than the wounds to her neck had been delivered after her death or as she was dying.
Her strangulation, slashed wrists and the blows to her head, were all capable of killing her.

Police had found a chainsaw and pruning saw in the bathroom, as well as a hammer and knife.

DC Summers added the police had concluded Mrs Parks was unlawfully killed by her husband, who subsequently took his own life.

She said they were satisfied there was no third-party involvement as there was no sign of forced entry, doors to the house had been locked on arrival, and there was no blood trail leading away from the property.

Mr Parks‚Äôs brother, Robert Parks, who is also a director in Parks Garden and Fencing Ltd, asked the pathologist whether any DNA testing had been done on his sister-in-law‚Äôs fingernails as he said: ‚ÄúIf she were fighting for her life, she might have scratched her assailant.‚Äù

But Dr Fitzpatrick-Swallow said no test had been done because her fingers were so badly stained with her own blood that any sample would have been compromised.

Robert Parks also stressed to the inquest that his brother had not entirely given up on going to Thailand; he was still hoping to go once he had sorted out his financial affairs.

DC Summers said prior to the attack, Richard Parks had taken steps to set his affairs in order.

He had made changes to his will just two days before and he had handed a folder of important documents and the combination to safe to his sister.

Coroner Roger Hatch concluded that Mrs Parks was unlawfully killed and that Richard Parks had taken his own life.
Robert Parks said: ‚ÄúThis is a terribly sad situation. Only those two will ever know exactly what happened.

‚ÄúThey loved each other very much and he was looking forward to going to Thailand - it‚Äôs just terribly sad for both families.‚Äù

I took to this fine sub and I wrote this with despondent rage:

The responses came in and I realised that I didn‚Äôt feel comfort in knowing so many of you had similar experiences. I felt rage that women of all ages and nationalities had dealt with the vile pox of sexism in the IT workplace. I held out for a tale of positivity, but there weren‚Äôt any. Our stories are universal and I hate it.

In my last job, upon meeting a team member for the first time, he balled up his fists and screeched, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs NOT EVEN TECHNICAL.‚Äù He knew only my gender and knew nothing of my background. Before the interview feedback for my promotion, I laughed and said to my husband, ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt accuse me of being NOT EVEN TECHNICAL.‚Äù And, as if that demonic sexist script is on repeat, I was turned down for a promotion for because I was Not Even Technical.

I‚Äôm going to try to facilitate a fortune change for at least one of us, so I‚Äôve created Not Even Technical, a sort-of public belching of all our horror stories meant to make the general public squirm in their seats.

[Original Posted Tuesday, September 17th, 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fitb9p/aita_for_snapping_at_my_parents_for_treating_me/)

[Update Posted Friday, September 27th, 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fqv6r7/update_aita_for_snapping_at_my_parents_for/)

I 23F am the oldest of three siblings. My parents divorced when I was 6 and both of them moved on. My mom remarried had two kids then divorced again. My dad has a daughter with his current girlfriend. We‚Äôre a big mixed family and we actually all get along pretty well. I love my siblings and I help with them a lot. Especially when we have family gatherings. But lately it feels like I‚Äôm expected to do everything. My parents only really talk to me when they want something.

Now I‚Äôm 3 months pregnant with my fianc√© and two weeks ago we had a family gathering. Like usual. I ended up watching all the kids. I didn‚Äôt mind much until after dinner. I sat down with a brownie sundae when my little sister (one of my mom‚Äôs kids) asked for a bite. I gave her some but then she kept asking for more and I ended up giving her most of it. My fianc√© said ""Okay now leave your big sister some"" and my dad responded with something like ""You should realize an older sister is like a second mother and that won‚Äôt change even when she has her own kids""

That hurt a little. I had really wanted that dessert but I gave it up for my sister anyway. And hearing my dad basically say that I‚Äôll always be expected to take care of everyone even when I have my own baby just hurt. My fianc√© tried to brush it off and went to see if there was still some left but my parents got defensive and started listing all the things an older sister should/expected to do.

I snapped and told them they‚Äôve never really treated me like a daughter. Just someone who‚Äôs expected to help out all the time. I immediately regretted it and apologized but my mom grabbed my sister and didn‚Äôt talk to me for the rest of the night. My dad didn‚Äôt say anything but now he barely responds to my texts. I‚Äôm worried I messed up my relationship with my parents and siblings. Did I overreact or how do I fix this?

**Comment:**

&gt;You didn't overreact. Clearly, they pushed you one step too far.

&gt;Given that you are pregnant, creating a gap between your new baby and your younger siblings in terms of expectations is not a bad thing. Your baby will take preference over your siblings, and especially young siblings will not like that given the way your parents have paretified you.

&gt;Don't worry they will come crawling back when the need something from you - this little game is just intended to have you feeling guilty and get you back into line so that they can continue to put upon you.

**Reply from OOP:**

&gt;Thanks for this. You‚Äôre probably right. I guess I‚Äôve been too focused on not upsetting anyone but I can‚Äôt keep being the go-to person. Especially with a baby on the way. It‚Äôs just hard not to feel guilty even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt. And yeah It‚Äôs definitely a pattern with them‚Ä¶ they pull away when they don‚Äôt get their way but come right back when they need something. Time to break the cycle I guess.

**\[The consensus was that OOP was NTA\]**

**UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my parents for treating me more like a second mom than their daughter?**

Thanks to everyone who commented and offered support. It really meant a lot. I wanted to give an update on what‚Äôs happened since.

Two days ago my dad called and said he was going to visit but then changed his mind and asked if we could meet somewhere instead. When I showed up my mom was with him (not sure why he didn‚Äôt mention that) My dad actually tried to listen and understand me but my mom didn‚Äôt really let me get my point across. It was so hard to explain how I‚Äôve been feeling recently and how it‚Äôs been like this for years. I was only 9 when my first sibling was born (he's 14 now) and I honestly can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôve been able to act like their daughter since then.

Every time I tried to explain how draining this has been. My mom would jump in with ""It was just a brownie"" I mean for God‚Äôs sake it‚Äôs not about the dessert. Eventually I just excused myself and went home. After that conversation I think I‚Äôve made up my mind to go lo contact with my mom. It‚Äôs going to be incredibly hard. More than I can even explain. I‚Äôve always said ""yes"" and put my family first but with my own little family on the way. I don‚Äôt want to bring these problems into everything. My fianc√© has been really supportive and said he‚Äôs with me no matter what I decide.

To answer some of the comments. My fianc√© and I don‚Äôt live with my parents. We have our own apartment and are working on building our first house. As for how I‚Äôm pregnant with my fianc√©. The pregnancy wasn‚Äôt planned but we decided to go through with it and we‚Äôre hoping to be the best parents we can be.

**Comment:**

&gt;You might want to ask your dad why he brought you mom. Tell him you thought you were going to have a one-on-one with him about what he said and having your mom there ended up being unproductive. If you don't want to talk to him, send him a note and see what he says.

&gt;Your mom is clearly a lost cause and you have your own baby and partner to prioritize.

2549,$OTIS Has Bonded! Reddit Power Sends the Internet‚Äôs Favorite Otter Memecoin Parabolic!,"The wait is over **$OTIS has officially bonded** and is now boosted on DEX, riding a massive wave of momentum, thanks to the Reddit community! The internet‚Äôs most beloved otter is no longer just a viral sensation; he‚Äôs now a trending memecoin, primed to deliver huge gains. üöÄ



**Otis the sea otter**‚Äîthe star of viral TikToks with \*\*92 million likes and a backstory so heartwarming it‚Äôs been featured in news articles‚Äîhas captured the hearts (and wallets) of Reddit. Rescued from an attacking eagle by sailors, Otis is now hand-fed salmon daily and living the dream. His adorable charm and Reddit‚Äôs 133k-strong otter community have combined to push $OTIS to new heights.



Incredible things happen when the Reddit army rallies, and they‚Äôve done it again with $OTIS! This memecoin has skyrocketed in popularity, hitting DEX boost and trending as it continues to attract more investors. 

Projects like **MOODENG** have proven how far these animal-themed tokens can go, but with Otis‚Äôs viral story, **$OTIS** is poised to go even further. Starting at a low cap, this memecoin has massive upside potential to hit tens or even hundreds of millions, and now that it‚Äôs bonded, the rocket is officially fueled.



This is what happens when a strong Reddit community backs a project‚Äîit bonds, it boosts, and it trends. If you haven‚Äôt already gotten on board, now is your chance. The parabolic rise of $OTIS is just beginning, and Reddit‚Äôs power has made it happen! Don‚Äôt miss out!

He pulls up and asks me what I am doing and I tell him I am out night hiking with nods. The officer was quite perplexed as I don't think he's ever even considered this a hobby. It goes through the standard questions and gets to whether you have any weapons on you. I never carry on forest preserve land as I don't want to get hit with poaching but I always carry this 24 inch oak bo staff while I'm out solo. I say no weapons but I got this stick.

Tres had emergency surgery yesterday, we almost lost him. My husband and I left for 2 hours yesterday for a doctor appointment. When we came back, we were greeted by Tres normally- he ran around, jumped and gave us all the kisses. Then he went to poop, right after he was about to roll in the grass and suddenly stopped, laying down slowly. I immediately checked his gums and they were white- practically grey. We immediately rushed him to the vet.. They removed his spleen, which had a 7cm nodule that ruptured and caused a hemorrhage. I am feeling an immense amount of regret and guilt for deciding not to remove his spleen back in May of this year. I was scared of the surgery and I made the decision carefully thinking about his age, risks, recovery and quality of life. My last dog had similar nodules in his spleen at 12 years old and I also made the decision not to do the surgery- he ended up living until he was almost 15 and didn‚Äôt have any problems. I made the decision based on this experience as well, and I‚Äôm just devastated right now that I made the wrong choice with Tres. But I guess there‚Äôs no point of thinking about the past now, all I can do is learn from what happened, and hope and prey Tres will pull through üíï

2626,My mom is upset because I want to work a job that requires weekends so she can't use my car - Am I the one being selfish?,"I currently live with my mom. Back in June I got laid off my job, which also covered housing. 

It sucked (cause I really loved that job and free rent), and while I had already lined up a place to live my mom offered me her home. 

Now while I was traveling for work there was no need for me to have my car so I left it with my mother who doesn't have a car. 

She normally wouldn't need a car but came into the care of her two grandchildren, which also required her to reenter the work force. She was lucky to land a mainly remote job but it does require her to come into the office once a week. 

I've been working my work schedule around her schedule, along with my school schedule (started an EMS program). 

I feel like I've been pretty compromisable with her, there have been times where I have given her my schedule weeks in advance and have had to change things last minute to accommodate some stuff she had to do. 

While I do live with her rent free, I do help out too. I do chores around the house, I take my nieces to and from school (as needed), clubs, and other things. I do grocery runs and errands for my mom. 

My mom constantly talks about how grateful she is for letting me use the car and how much money she's saving by letting her use the car. And it is my car I pay all of the car and all the insurance, including her insurance too. 

But the thing that happened that prompted me to even write this, is that I was promised a promotion at my current day job and two times now it was given to someone else. 

So I decided I was going to look for a new job. I told a friend I was looking for a job, and he so happened to be a manager somewhere and was looking for someone, and offered me a job where I would I make more than I would've made with that promotion. The thing is it was Thursday - Sunday. Which I didn't mind I actually prefer working weekends because I don't like going out when everything is crowded. 

I told my mom, and I thought she'd be excited because I'd be doing a job that I actually liked, I'd get way more money, and I would have to work less. Instead she started talking about how I would be working all weekend. And she didn't outright say it but she kept commenting things like

""Guess you'll have the car all weekend huh?""

""Guess we can't do anything in the weekend?""

""Better plan all my shopping trips on the weekdays after work. Guess I can just walk.""

""It'll be hard to take the kids to the movies, I guess we can always just Uber there.""

The worst part is she always ends it with, ""Oh, I'm not saying this to deter you from taking the job or anything like that. We'll be fine, we can just Uber everywhere.""

Then why do you keep making comments?!

I honestly have no idea if I'm in the wrong or overreacting. I thought it was fair considering I'm living with her rent free, but I feel like I'm getting taken advantage of and being gaslit. 

Opinions?

Edit:

""Why can't she just drop you off?"" 

I was getting this asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. So she does that sometimes with my current day job, and while she never complains or says anything, she always has this negative attitude while doing it so I didn't ask her with this new job. But she actually brought it up (during one of her side comments) that it would be "" too much for her to drive me to and from the new job because it's so far"". In my opinion it's not far, if there's no crazy traffic, it's roughly a 30 - 40 minute commute. 

We've actually been arguing over this (not related to the job but just in general my mom always thinks everything is too far), she keeps saying it's an hour drive but when I pulled it up on maps it was a 35 minute drive.

2632,Joshlilj is ruining restaurant Google reviews in the metro area,"I hadn‚Äôt heard of this guy until I stumbled upon some Google reviews for a Nautical Bowls location I drove past one day. Curious about their menu and reputation, I decided to check out what people were saying. The place had an impressive star rating‚Äîsomething like 4.8 or 4.9‚Äîwith a lot of reviews, which caught my attention. But as I started reading through them, I kept seeing mentions of how ‚Äúkind the owner is for feeding the homeless.‚Äù I thought that was nice, but then I noticed more reviews saying things like, ‚ÄúI live in X country and have never been here, but the owner is so kind!‚Äù It was kind-hearted, sure, but didn‚Äôt really speak to the actual product or service being offered.

Eventually, someone mentioned the name of the TikTok creator behind all this, and it turned out to be a guy named ‚ÄúJoshlilj.‚Äù

When I checked out his TikTok, I noticed all his videos followed the same formula. He goes to a restaurant in the metro area, works with the owner ahead of time on a video concept where he‚Äôll place a comically large order. The owner always acts puzzled‚Äîsomething like, ‚ÄúwHaT dO yOu NeEd aLL tHiS fOoD fOr!?‚Äù‚Äîand Joshlilj responds that it‚Äôs to ‚Äúfeed the homeless.‚Äù This usually involves him filming himself handing out food to people around St. Paul‚Äôs homeless shelters. The restaurant owners (badly) pretend to be touched by the gesture and offer the food for free. Then, inevitably, a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù commenter suggests everyone flood the restaurant‚Äôs Google review page with 5-star ratings for their generosity.

Some of these videos have gotten over a million views. The places I‚Äôve noticed that have participated so far include:

- Nautical Bowls
- Chick-fil-A
- Frank &amp; Andrea Pizza
- Pink Ivy
- Lago Tacos
- Bubble Tea &amp; Mochi Donuts (EP)

...and many more.

This is just a PSA to check Google reviews more carefully. High ratings might be padded by these kinds of stunts, hiding mediocre or bad reviews behind a generosity-driven facade.

What started as a fun, once a week bonding activity has morphed into daily 6+ hour games that carry on until our eyes burn in the middle of the night. I hear my partner muttering in their sleep about adjacency bonuses. Our romantic date nights have turned into scheming sessions. They have even integrated it into their vocabulary:

I don‚Äôt know -&gt; I don‚Äôt have that tech yet

You‚Äôre being annoying -&gt; you sound like Pericles

Stop scratching the carpet (to our cat) -&gt; stop pillaging my improvements

As a longtime player, I know what it‚Äôs like to get lost in the sauce. One more turn eventually becomes a twisted folly‚Äîevery breath, thought, and heartbeat belongs to Sid Meier. I‚Äôve told my partner that I don‚Äôt want our relationship to go down this dark path‚Ä¶to no avail. 

Finally, I tried to explain my feelings in more familiar terms: ‚ÄúI no longer feel like the suzerain of your heart. I worry that instead of proposing one day, you will just gift me a diamond luxury.‚Äù

2650,Brussels is Terrible,"Brussels was... underwhelming¬†

So I had heard a lot of interesting stories on Reddit about Brussels, and I was eager to explore for myself. I went on the train to the infamous Gare du Midi in Brussels.¬†

The first problem was the fact it was a sunny day, which already dampened my expectations. I waddled out of the unassuming train station looking for the expected crack junkies, but did not find any. Bummer. Maybe I should have arrived in the evening. Maybe a chance on the ride back. So I went out for a walk along a long sort of promenade with trees along the way. The amount of trash was a bit lackluster, maybe I went on the wrong day. I did spot some bags and a few planks close to the street tho, so the little things count I guess. Finally a saw two hobos asleep near a building. Finally.¬†¬†

I then visited both the comic museum and the Natural Museum of History. Its a shame the Brussels Museum of Natural History is not more well known, it has an interesting array of fossils, including the famous Iguanodons of Bernissaert.¬†

But to my horror I was not raped, stabbed, robbed, or murdered even once during my visit. Even on my way back in the evening I hardly spotted any junks. I visited three other times after that but still no luck.¬†

But in all seriousness

  
What is the deal with Brussels on reddit? I have literally seen people state that Brussels is, according to them, more unsafe than places like Chicago or Baltimore(yes, I am not kidding). The hate for Brussels on reddit is quite extreme, and I am saying that as a dutchman.

Of course, compared to the cities in my own country, Brussels has a lot more rundown buildings, more visible homelessness(you almost never see homeless people in the Netherlands, except during Covid), and is generally dirtier and more unkempt. But that holds true for Belgian cities in general, and cities like Paris and Rome also had visible dirtyness, sketchiness and homelessness. 

So I looked up some statistics, and when you take the average of the homicide rate of the last say 6 or 7 years it is around 2.3.

 That is higher than Amsterdam sure(1,85). But if you do the same for Chicago you get 25(not 2.5, but 25, which is 10 times as high a rate as Brussels) and in Baltimore its more like 46(!!).

Its not even close to being close, just the accidental victims of stray bullets would probably lead to a higher number than the Brussels homicide rate. 

  
By the way, I have visited Brussels like over 20 times, including gare du Nord and Midi. The shadiest part of that city is the red light district next to gare du Nord, but even that place is not even close to being close to being close to Middle east, Baltimore. Its just a bizarre comparison. Why the exaggeration? ",/r/travel/comments/1frdbjj/brussels_is_terrible/

2692,"Teenage girl vanishes from her house during the night; Case's background involves 18 foster homes, adult men luring the victim through snapchat to party and issues within the child protective system- where is Ella Saylor? (2024)","Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your votes and comments under my last post about the Fort Lauterdale Jane Doe- I hope that her name will be given back to her soon.



Today I'd like to cover a very recent disappearance case.  


BACKGROUND

  
Ella Saylor was 15 when she went missing from Muncie, Indiana, USA.

  
To say that Ella had a rough start in life would be a massive understatement. She was born in Marion, Indiana, and lived in a house that didn't even have running water- if Ella needed to access it, she had to go to a gas station that was a couple blocks away; She was also frequently deprived of food. The house had no electricity, but a neighbour threw an extension cord through the fence to help out- but when that person moved away, Ella lost her only support. When Ella was five, her baby sister was born- Ella was, once again, forced to grow up fast when she had to start looking after the newborn too. When she visited her childhood home at the age of 11, she noticed trash strewn around it and said ""Oh look, cigarettes, broken glass, a diaper... it basically, describes my childhood life"". Ella was removed from the home on the 1st of January 2014.

  
The sisters were under the patronage of Kim Dunham, a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA)- from what I understand, these people are volunteers who are supposed to represent the needs and expectations of children from difficult backrounds in court; They're ment to get to know the child and their story to then make sure that they're being taken into a good foster family. 



By the age of 7, Ella has lived in 18 foster homes- after each failed foster placement, the sisters were reunited with their mother in an attempt to connect the family. Kim was determined to get the girls out of their situation and into a loving family- one that would be willing to adopt them both. She contacted Phil and Elizabeth Saylors, who were foster parents, in 2016, and asked them to take Ella and her sister, but the Saylors have refused- three times, in fact. Kim even told them that if they won't adopt the sisters, she will quit being a CASA and will take them in herself. However, it seems like third time was the charm, and the Saylors took Ella and her sister in in 2016, when Ella was about 7 and her sister was just 6 months old; The girls were officially adopted in 2018.



Ella was seemingly a difficult child at first- the first two weeks after an adoption are sometimes referred to as the ""honeymoon phase"", but Phil said that they had ""no break"" and that there was no ""honeymoon phase"". At some point, the couple was ready to give up, but Kim kept telling them to ""stay positive"". While the couple was sometimes annoyed by it, the phrase became their motto- two years later, in 2020, Elizabeth said that, otherwise, they wouldn't have ""a smart, intelligent, wonderful child, that (they did)"", and Phil said that they were ""Proud of (Ella)"".

  
Ella's favorite color was teal. She loved to play the violin, sketch landscapes and learn Japanese. She was also a big fan of the Harry Potter books and adored reading. Ella lived with five younger adopted siblings (including her biological sister), and she often entertained them.

  
In 2019, Ella was a student in North Side Middle School, and she unfortunately fell in with the wrong crowd- she started to disrespect her teachers and fail her classes. In response, the Saylors took her out of the public school and started to homeschool her through online classes. When it came time for Ella to attend Muncie Central (a highschool), the Saylors told her that if she'd keep doing well in her online classes, she would be allowed to attend school in-person. Ella was reportedly both excited and anxious to go to a standard school again. During the time Ella was homeschooled, the Saylors thought that they developed a good relationship with her due to spending a lot of one-on-one time together. 



It all changed for the worse when Ella started to go to school with her peers. At some point, she recieved a cellphone from someone- the Saylors kept a single cellphone at home for all the kids to use, but Ella didn't have her own phone. Ella started to use social media, with her favorite being Snapchat, as the messages disappear after some time. She had at least two phones- at some point, Elisabeth discovered one and destroyed it. After that incident, Ella managed to get another one, which made Elisabeth ""livid"". 



Before the disappearance I'm describing in this write-up, Ella has actually went missing once. It was just a month after she started highschool- she left behind a note that said that she ""couldn't go back now"" and that ""There (was) no turning away, (She had) got to go"". Ella was reported missing on the 20th of September at 7 AM- it was established that she changed out of her nightgown sometime in the night and left through the front door between 11:30 PM and 4:30 AM. Thanks to a friend, the Saylors found out that Ella had a snapchat account and got her username. After Elisabeth ""guessed"" the password, the couple found out that Ella had been communicating with two adult men from Indianapolis; Ella gave one of them her home address and he came to pick her up. During their chats, Ella would send photos of herself and videos containing her voice. Ella was picked up in Indianapolis by the police two or three days later, and had to be hospitalized at Riley Children‚Äôs Health before returning to home with the Saylors- the men she was with gave her alcohol and weed. After the incident, Ella was sent to the Simon Skjodt Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health Unit at Riley Children‚Äôs Hospital for two weeks- she was just 14 at the time. One of the men was arrested, but later released, since he claimed that Ella told him that she was 18. 

  
Ella returned home on the 3rd of October. Her behavioral safety plan included ""locking away all sharps ‚Ä¶ chemicals ‚Ä¶ medications ‚Ä¶ with increased supervision at home. The team recommended that she continue to see her therapist and that the parents watch her for warning signs, including changes in sleeping, eating and talking‚Äù. At home, Ella was angry with the Saylors, and claimed that they were neglecting her and abusing her mentally. Due to the accusations, the DCS opened a petition regarding Ella on the 20th of October 2023, though it was later revealed that no contact with Elizabeth and Phil was established to talk about Ella. Later that month, the DCS took Ella from the Saylor's house. 



As a result, Ella was sent to live with a new foster family in another city. However, her new foster parents weren't informed of Ella's past runaway attempt and social media usage, and Ella recieved a new phone from them. After three months, the foster parents asked for Ella to be removed from their care- they said that she was ""always talking to someone or herself in the bathroom"", and they once caught her ""in the middle of the night, staring into their new baby‚Äôs bassinet, kicking it"". The foster parents said that they knew that there was no risk of Ella being a harm to herself, but they were worried that they might lose their fostering license due to Ella's ""continued lies"". 

  
The therapist who looked after Ella since 2017 said that they see no evidence of Ella being abused by the Saylors- she was disciplined sometimes, but it never went beyond being sent to her room or having to write sentences. A court proceeding didn't find the Saylors to be neglectful or abusive, and so Ella returned to their home on the 30th of January 2024. She was reportedly angry for the wole first night, but seemed to do better and more friendly in the next few days. 

  
DISAPPEARANCE

  
Ella was last seen around 11 PM on the 3rd of February. 

  
The day before Ella went missing was pretty ordinary- a family member was visiting, so the Saylors ordered dinner at an applebees restaurant, put the younger children to bed and stayed up for a bit longer as usual. Ella reportedly acted how she usually did- she gave her family hugs, they told her that they loved her, and Ella went to bed at around 11 PM. 

  
When the Saylors woke up, the door was unsecured and Ella wasn't in her bedroom. The saylors believe that Ella might've smuggled a cellphone in her bra when she returned to their home. 

  
A statewide Silver Alert was issued after she was reported missing, which stated that Ella ""(is) believed to be in extreme danger and may require medical assistance"". 



There are no leads as to where Ella might be- there were a few sightings of her, but they all turned out to be dead ends. Ella has seemingly learned from her previous ""mistakes"" and became more aware of how to cover her tracks better.



CONCLUSION

  
This case is quite unique as far as disappearances go, because we have a lot of background info, but not a lot about the actual disappearance. It's not a bad thing, but the case itself feels like a grim conclusion and not the start of the story like it usually is. 

  
Ella had an absolutely awful start in life, which became the cause of everything that happened afterwards. Philip says in one of the sources that Ella was forced to grow up too quickly, and that's absolutely the case, since she had to not only look after herself but also her baby sister in absolutely decrepid environment. 

  
I do believe that, after she was removed from her house as a child, everyone had good intentions and wanted the best for her, but I wonder if they were equipped to deal with a child with as many problems as she had. This isn't me trying to judge the Saylors or Kim Dunham- from what I know about them, they seem to be honest people who wanted to help Ella and give her a stable environment to grow up in. However, taking in a child with such a difficult past, behavioral problems and a long list of previous foster homes is a huge challenge, one that requires specific knowledge. I don't know if the Saylors got any sort of preparation or classes- For example, it was a bit odd to me that they took Ella from school when she got into a bad crowd, or just took away her phone when she managed to obtain one- it strikes me as removing Ella from a problem instead of teaching her how to navigate it; Then again, I am only working with the bits of info we were given, and I have no experience in raising a difficult child- it's just loose speculation and wondering. 

  
With that being said, I'd be grateful if everyone went easy on Ella- she was clearly a troubled kid who struggled in life, and her behaviors like running away or acting up were the results of that. I know that some people tend to call teens like Ella ""brats"", ""ungrateful"", or even worse, but please, let's show some empathy and understanding. Almost all teens act up or are rude at least sometimes, and Ella was no exception. She was abused by her biological family and tricked by adults with bad intentions- let's give her some grace. 

  
I feel like Ella most likely ran away to be with some older people like she did before, maybe even the same ones. Best case scenario is that she is living with someone older and that she will resurface once she turns 18; It's not a very likely one, but maybe it's similar to Alicia Navarro's case, where a teen girl with behavioral/mental issues got groomed online by someone older and went to live with them. It's horrible to say in hindsight, but many people, myself included, were convinced that Alicia was dead, and yet she resurfaced when she was 18, physically unharmed, though we don't know about how well she's fairing in the mental health department. 

  
There is a chance that Ella is being trafficked, but I don't know how likely that is; While Ella was deeply troubled, she had a loving and supportive family who noticed her missing and reported her within hours- wouldn't that be too big of a risk? 

  
Of course, sadly, there's of course the possibility that Ella was killed by whoever lured her out of her home, on purpose or by accident (something like an overdose). I think that it's the most likely- I doubt that anyone who managed to groom her saw her as anything but disposable.



Elizabeth and Philip decided to let their foster license go because they believe that the ""DCS did not conduct a proper investigation, did not advise the temporary foster parents, and because they wrongfully removed their children""- they are currently looking into ways to hold the DCS accountable. The couple says that the whole family is deeply traumatized after the events that lead to Ella's disappearance, and that the whole family has to seek help for their mental health issues, including all of their children. They are deeply in debt and say that they doubt that they will ever get out of it. Ella's purple thermos is still in its place on the counter, as if it's waiting for her to come back. Elizabeth says that she ""Loves that girl"", referring to Ella, and that she's afraid that she is being held somewhere against her will- she's not sure if Ella will ever come home. 

  
Ella Saylor was 15 when she went missing. She's White, 5' 4"" inch, 230 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes- she also had braces on her teeth. She was last seen wearing a gray hoodie with ‚ÄúWashington D.C.‚Äù on the front and black pajama pants with puzzle pieces. Ella has ""possible ties"" to Indianapolis and Connersville, as well as to the Auburn/Garrett area in northeastern Indiana. She was believed to be traveling with two bags, one a gray backpack and the other a rolling carry-on sized suitcase.

2712,I DID IT!,"My journey started in December of 2023, not long after a doctor cruelly told me the only reason I was eligible for Paxlovid was because I was morbidly obese. After much thinking I recognized that needing medication to help me lose weight did not equal failure. My starting weight was 252, I‚Äôm 55 and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù. I thought maybe Mounjaro would help me lose enough weight to safely get gastric bypass surgery. I started my 2.5 dose with a lot of shame and only told my mother. Then the weight started to come off, and come off and come off. I rode it out through shortages and side effects (thankfully mine weren‚Äôt horrible). I set a goal of 190 and then 170. Then I moved the needle to 160. When I got to 140 I knew I‚Äôd be happy to stay there but would still be considered overweight and set my sights on 135, the highest weight that‚Äôs considered healthy for my height. Today I got on the scale and I weigh 134.4 pounds. Boy did I cry when I got that reading and while my dog wasn‚Äôt overly impressed (she just wanted her breakfast)I sure as hell was. I haven‚Äôt been this weight since before I had children (who are 32 and 24). The best thing‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt want to go buy a dozen donuts to celebrate. When I see my doctor in November we will talk about figuring out a maintenance dose. As always I am eternally grateful for Mounjaro which helped me find the me I thought I had lost and I realize that it is a privilege to afford this medication. I won‚Äôt ever lose sight of that or stop fighting for all insurances to cover this. Thanks to everyone in this group for the encouragement, wisdom and humor. I don‚Äôt know you but your posts have gotten me through side effects, just wanting to give up and the frustration when the medication was in short supply. 
For those of you just starting out remember each person‚Äôs journey will be different. If you‚Äôre stuck, find the non-scale victories on the weeks you don‚Äôt have scale victories. Today my blood pressure and cholesterol are at healthy levels, my A1C is 5.7 and my fatty liver has repaired itself. I‚Äôve also been able to help the unhoused community with a lot of clothes and coats since December and have probably kept Kohls in business single-handedly.

2731,"Unpopular opinion, preparing for downvotes ","I have been seeing near daily posts from people boasting about how they screamed, slapped, publicly shamed, etc. an older person for touching their baby. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am a certified germaphobe with major anxiety. But an older woman stroking my baby‚Äôs cheek? It‚Äôs just not that big of a deal. 

Seeing babies leads to literal biological responses in human. We have an evolutionary drive to cherish the young. I actually love when old people want to see my baby and give him a little pat on the head or squeeze his cheek. This happened at the grocery store yesterday and my little man smiled brightly at the old woman and you can tell her eyes just lit up. It makes me sad to think about my elder relatives admiring a baby and being shamed for it.

If your anxiety is too much to handle a kind person‚Äôs physical interaction with your baby, just politely move away and say ‚Äúoh baby gets sick easily, we‚Äôre not taking chances!‚Äù

I own one of the free movie sites like 123movies.

We have over 250k movies in our database, and we get DMCA takedown notices daily.

We earn all our money from pop-up ads.

We do respect DMCA takedown notices. If we get a DMCA takedown notice, we will remove the specific movie.

We also have requests from Indie Movies to be removed, which we do as we support indie movies.

We have over 25 domains, all of which have the same design. Assets are shared, same with movies, which makes it 50 times easier to manage. It does not earn good money at all, but luckily I own the hosting company, so it's fine.

EDIT: i do not understand why people are downvoting the post, if you have something to say please say it in the comments, i really do wanna understand why.

When Sanrio's contract with Peanuts ended, they decided to make a new original character inspired by the beloved little beagle with a big imagination. So, in 1989 Sanrio introduced their own sweet, adorable, playful black and white puppy named Pochacco, and Japan fell in love with him, just like they did with Snoopy.

Plus, my thesis presentation should be engaging‚ÄîI'm graduating in animation‚Äîso I don't think she'll find it boring.

Why this idea in the first place?
It started with her asking if she could go with me. Initially I thought it's not a good idea but then I started to think about it more and more... 

She‚Äôs grown up alongside my studies, watching every stage of my work. She‚Äôs seen the evolution of my animation from rough sketches to the final product, and she's even part of the film herself!

More than that, she's witnessed many of my struggles. Among other things, during my studies, I fought through depression and gave birth to her sister. It was tough, but I never gave up. I want her to see what perseverance and hard work can accomplish, and that it's always worth fighting for yourself. I think it's important for her to be there and to remember that I brought her to such a significant moment in my life.


Or maybe I‚Äôm just romanticizing the whole thing and I‚Äôll come across as a bit of a crazy mom.

3069,[21] I overcame obesity [23],"I've lost 50kg in 2 years without bariatric surgery. Currently, I‚Äôm able to take better care of myself and I have gained self-esteem, but it‚Äôs a bit difficult to deal with how people treat me differently now. I live in a small town in the interior of Brazil, with 30,000 inhabitants, and now even those who bullied me don't recognize me. It's complicated, but I'm doing well. I'm always looking forward and focused on progress, striving to be my best version.

Even with all the changes, my weight loss left me feeling a bit unstable about my body. I developed some dysphoria and decided to get plastic surgery.

UPDATE! Red is SAFE and in a forever home! He no longer will be living on the streets. No longer will go to sleep hungry, have to worry where his next meal will come from, where a safe place to rest his head will be, protecting himself from predators and cruel people... he's safe. And he's the happiest I've ever seen him in the entire 2 months he was living in my mobile home park. He always walked around with a an exhausted and despaired look on his face, and who could blame him? He doesn't have to worry about any of that now. He found his people, he found HIS home. So many people rooted for him, and those positive thoughts and wishes worked in his favor. Red truly deserved this amazing outcome. ü•π

I want to thank everyone for caring so much about this sweet boy and for being so patient regarding my responses to know if it all ended well. It definitely did. He lucked out with the perfect home, and it truly couldn't have been a better match. Between networking to find Red an adopter/or foster, coordinating transport, communicating with the amazing TNR caretaker who offered to board him for a week while I figured out a plan, and caring for a TNR'd feral for a week + a one-eyed cat for 5 days who was just picked up by the rescue this morning and is being transported 6 hours to his foster home... plus caring for 5 of my own... it's been a bit chaotic! But it paid off and my heart is full and happy, as I'm sure so many people will feel the same way once they see this video of him in his new home.

This is why rescue is so important, as well as spaying and neutering. To promise that each cat, especially the ones dumped/abandoned, find their forever home and can leave a lasting imprint on so many lives. Please consider adopting from your local county shelter or fostering a cat from your nearest rescue, and don't forget to spay and neuter your pets. If you can no longer keep an animal due to personal circumstances, reach out for help. It's out there, I promise. Don't dump them and leave them to survive on their own, because chances are they won't make it very long. Together we can make a world of a difference for so many.

Love you, Red. May you enjoy your new home, you sweet beautiful orange boy!

Backstory: This is my girl, Koda. I rescued her over a year ago from my local shelter for $25. She was estimated at 2 years old. The shelter attempted to send her to working dog programs but she was rejected, then she was adopted and returned. When I adopted her, she had no training.

At least three of them they decided not to hire anyone.


Now they've reposted a bunch of jobs, like what I already do, but for 10 to 15,000 less. I belive they are Ghost Jobs, to drive down salary. Pure evil.

Even the project manager positions that were advertised two years ago at 80,000 to 100,000 are now at a measly 45 to 60,000.

Meanwhile, the executives are getting almost a million dollars a year in a town where the average home cost is 250,000. If I work another 30 years, I won't be able to save that much money. And even if I did, in 30 years from now, that same house would be what? $4 million.

3194,"I just returned from a bachelor party in Florida, with a roundtable of swing state Trumpsters.  Everyone here needs to VOTE!!!","Our echo chamber may sound like Kamala has this in the bag, but that isn‚Äôt necessarily the truth.

A group of my high school friends and I just returned from a bachelor party in South Florida.  I live in CA.  My friends are early 30s Millennial white men from GA, TX, FL, AZ, TN, and LA.  About half of these guys have advanced degrees or work as civil engineers on government contracts.  

My story is a warning to all of you that many of your male friends, colleagues, neighbors, and fathers at your child‚Äôs pre-school plan on enthusiastically voting for Trump.  Their main reasoning is *the Economy* and that Kamala would ‚Äúnuke‚Äù it by encouraging Congress to pass an Unrealized Gains Tax‚Äîan idea that has little practical chance of even coming to fruition.  

It‚Äôs a tale of two Worlds.  One is where most of here stand‚Äîan America with an Opportunity Economy that embraces Freedom and the differences between us.  The other‚Äîa society where we remain indifferent, apathetic, and suspicious of those who are different.  They fully believe that a cat being eaten in Springfield should be the focus of this election.  That bringing the working classes to a period of Prosperity is a fool‚Äôs errand and that we are better off pleasing billionaires.  

These voters see Kamala as the biggest *threat* in the room‚Äînot Trump.  The sexism and racism runs super deep to the point they don‚Äôt even see that they are being racist and sexist.  How is a woman who was elected multiple times as District Attorney, Attorney General, Senator, and now, Vice President, more incompetent than the founder of Trump University?  It is suspended logic, but yet here we are.

This wasn‚Äôt just one conversation, but a string of multiple conversations that spanned over the weekend.  People of all demographics are poisoned by the false rhetoric of FOX and Newsmax.  It nearly shattered my heart comprehending that team Kamala still needs to fight, hard! 

This is going to be the closest election yet if the numbers of right.  It is up to us‚Äîand the many Gen Z and Women first time voters‚Äîto change the course of history forever.  To put Trump and his cronies in the dustbin of history.  

This is it.  One month to go.  We still have A TON of work to do in these Sun Belt states.  I just looked at electoral maps the other day, and it‚Äôs a very narrow path of victory if Kamala were to win just the Blue Wall and the coastal states.  

We watched the debate.  We know the Assignment.  Know that nobody in your swing/red state family will know who you truly voted for.  A vote for Kamala is SAFE!  A vote for Kamala is an investment in America‚Äôs future.  Above all else, pray that this election is an inflection point that turns the tide of our country into something extraordinary.

Usually, security is positioned in plain sight but gets you going downhill.  

All roads are private (no police patrols), and there is question as to if anyone in security is trained on how to use the radar gun or if it is even calibrated.  Since this is a private community, getting a ticket can't be faught in court but rather before the HOA board.  I don't have access to the radar, but what can I use to screw with it?

3290,Found elders s*x toys while helping them recover belongings after the hurricane.,"(f17) Holy shit. Never been so baffled. Hurricane Helene hit my town pretty hard and before my family even started fixing our property post hurricane, we were asked to help others in the congregation first. 

The family we went to go help was an elder, his wife and disabled son. the couple is in their late 60s-70s and have always been highly respected in our congregation. I have suspected sketchy shit from certain people in my congregation but definitely not this family.

Okay so we arrive at the home (or whats left of it) to help them recover belongings and I get to their master bedroom which is completely flooded in probably 3 feet of water. Im trying to grab whatever I can and pull a night stand out of the water. All the drawers spill out and floating in the water is several dildos, vibrators and gags. 

I was shocked. Still am. Tried assembling the night stand to put everything back but I start struggling and my brother walks into the room. He sees the amount of sex toys, grabs my arm and pulls me out of the room. Me and him havent spoken a word about it. Just made intense eye contact in the car.

I honestly can't believe this and I understand if this story sounds unbelievable, because it does. Just wanted to vent it all out because holy shit?

edit: no im not shocked at adults owning personal toys, im aware thats normal im mainly shocked because of their age and how well respected they are in the congregation üôÑ",/r/exjw/comments/1frq8xp/found_elders_sx_toys_while_helping_them_recover/

Storm Blue Tri R1S

I was a bit nervous that when I finally had one the excitement would fade but it has been the complete opposite, I keep thinking of excuses to drive and already planning some trips.

Delivery experience was average, lower part of the dash was hanging off (tech popped the clips back in) each front door was missing a clip from the water seal (thanks to another poster who pointed theirs out).  Wildest part though was that one of my mirrors was the wrong color (El Cap), they are going to send a tech out when they get the replacement but if one of you new El Cap owners has a Storm Blue mirror...  Our vehicles now share a mystical connection.

Last bits, I am blown away by the interior, cool bit I havent seen mentioned elsewhere is that the grab handles match the ascent floor mats.  Also, I think the audio is ok, haven't fully played with it, I have a feeling the Crux of the issue is that Tesla's audio is just AMAZING and this is simply great.

3385,My bf decided to unload how he feels about my weight gain while drunk at a bar with his coworkers,"My bf(30m) and I (28f) have been together for 8 years this December. I was diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago after gaining an insane amount of weight in a short time after stopping birth control. Hand in hand, I was diagnosed with depression as well around the same time. 

Losing the weight wa and still is incredibly hard for me. I'd lose a few then gain them back. Even if I did lose a few my bf won't be impressed and never said good work. 

He absolutely doesn't believe in eating healthy. Or that my condition requires me to eat healthier than him. He says I just need to exercise more and more. I just run for 2 hours lift weight for 2 hours. All those drastic exercise things, I should do. But eating healthy is bullshit. So he's never fully supported me in anything. The exercises I do is useless. All those shit. 

We went out last night and his co workers were seated at the table right behind us. He knew this. He got drunk really quick. I mentioned what I wanted to eat and he lost his shit on me. Going on for a good 20 min on how being fat is my fault and he can't believe I haven't lost the weight yet and he hates the way I look now and he literally just went on and then said something in the Lords name then a guy on another table stood up and told him dude, you dont speak like that. And my bf shut up. (During this time I told him to please stop everyone is staring. And every time he'll get louder and say he doesn't care he wants me to hear this because of my health)

When he was done he said fuck this, turned around and sat next to his coworkers. I was literally to stunned to speak. One of them asked me if I wanted water or should they help me get him home. I opted for the latter. When I got home I just cried and my bf just crashed on the bed. I felt so humiliated and ashamed.

I know I'm overweight, and trust me I hate how I look too now. I am trying my best to lose it. Especially on the days when my depression feels so bad. I walk and run longer miles because I know I'm not going to do anything else. 

This isn't the first time he lashed out about it like this too, but this is the first time where he's done it in public.",/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1frgk9q/my_bf_decided_to_unload_how_he_feels_about_my/

3452,"$250,000 Annual salary for watching movies ","You are offered a job with a $250,000 salary, benefits, and two weeks of paid time off. The work seems straightforward: watch 3-4 random movies assigned to you in an isolated, windowless room for an 8-hour shift.

The movies will be randomly chosen from a vast database containing every film ever made. Subtitles will be provided for foreign-language films. You will have no control over the selection and no say in which films you watch.

There are no coworkers, no phone for distractions, and no communication with anyone else during the day. After each movie, a 10-question multiple choice quiz must be completed, with an 80% passing score required to get paid for the entire two-week pay period. If even one test is failed, no paycheck is issued for those two weeks. The quizzes are simple, provided full attention is given to each movie. You are granted a pad and paper for note taking. 

You are issued a standard 30 minute lunch break where you are allowed to use your phone and do as you please. Bathroom breaks are permitted and the movie will be paused while you‚Äôre away. 

Water is permitted into ‚Äú the office‚Äù. Snacks are not.

The job is a 5 year contract - failure to finish the 5 years results in losing all of the money you‚Äôve earned. Do you accept this position?",/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1frji26/250000_annual_salary_for_watching_movies/

3500,20th PS4 vs 30th PS5 preorder experiences so far,"The 20th anniversary PS4 preorder experience felt very memorable. I remember jumping up and down in disbelief when I got my order in for that one, on a 2009 13‚Äù MacBook Pro on Wi-Fi. And it arrived on Christmas Eve, the day my family celebrates Christmas, so it was very special. While I went in, feeling unsure but optimistic for the 30th Pro bundle, the adrenaline rush was there. Ordered from my 2017 12‚Äù MacBook still on macOS Mojave (didn‚Äôt wanna lose my 32 bit programs!) so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. The 20th experience felt a lot more tailored for the occasion. Still super excited about the 30th pro, but there was a charm about the 20th preorder that hit different. And I‚Äôve been using my 20th PS4, #8883, to this day.

I replied "" I thought this was a date since I specifically asked if you would like to go out for food and drinks with me? "". She basically said her friend wanted to come for security reasons. 

I got annoyed and said "" I'm not doing 3 person date, sorry have a good one "" and left. 

I'm 27 year old with almost no free time looking for a serious partner, not some situation-ship or a fun night. My profile also clearly states "" looking for something serious and long term "".

My daughter is 13. Last year she had an obstructing kidney stone which almost killed her - sepsis, 4 surgeries. Finally a diagnosis of an ultra rare metabolic disorder that causes her liver to make too much oxalate, which is destroying her kidneys via stone formation. 

She has developed chronic functional pain from the extreme pain of the stones and the lesser pain of the surgeries, stents, etc. Functional pain is where the brain is misinterpreting non-pain stimulus as pain, like a faulty fire alarm. She has been referred to  the pain clinic at our kids hospital and is just starting to work with them. In the meantime, she goes through agonizing pain every single day. 

She is slated for another 2 surgeries in 2 and 4 weeks bc she is forming stones so fast. 

I just found out yesterday that Her oxalate numbers are through the roof. 8x what they should be. This puts her at high risk for oxalosis - the oxalate (the main ingredient in kidney stones) cannot be cleared from her blood and starts to deposit in her organs, eyes, blood vessels, etc. 

It is an orphan disease with no meds available to help her. We are waiting for an appt w her nephrologist in 2 weeks, but I imagine we are going to have to start talking about a preemptive liver transplant. 

My heart is breaking. I feel like I want to throw up. My daughter, my child. I love her so much and I am helpless to deliver her from all this. 

One hour after I found out this recent bad news I went to Mass. I ate the body of my Lord. I put that wafer in my mouth and cried out for my daughter. 

Her name is Paige. Please hold her in your prayers. Please hold me and her father in your prayers.

I peeped the website and here's the breakdown:
1st prize: 500 per team. So that's $250 per person 
Gas: ~$50 (assuming he wasn't dumb enough to fly)
Food: $150 (3 days)
Registration + fees(as listed on the website): $70/person
Hotel, tournament rate: ~120/night*. Let's say 3 nights:$360. Split between him and his partner, ~$180/person

So total fees per person: ~$450 (not counting extra food, merch, etc. Just care bones

Possible prize money: $500 per team, so $250/person.

450 (expenses) - prize ($250) means a net loss of $200 for this tournament.

3545,"Today is my birthday, and the father of my child is going to die. Just like all of the others.","I hate my birthday.

This year is no different. I awaken feeling full and wrong, too weak to pull myself into a sitting position.

My pillows are filthy, the blanket draped over still stained from my last birthday. 

‚ÄúJasper,‚Äù I whisper, blinking at the ceiling.

‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my birthday.‚Äù

I feel him stiffen, his body curling into itself. I pretend not to notice his trembling, goosebumps prickling his bare arms. Before I can comfort him, the door flies open. We both jolt upright, Jasper reaching for my hand under the blanket. 

The lights flicker on, too bright. Jasper‚Äôs eyes widen, his lips parting in a silent cry. He‚Äôs scared. 

I know he‚Äôs scared because my birthday is the day he will die.

‚ÄúDarling!‚Äù Mrs. Tilsey enters the room, holding my ninth birthday cake, her lipstick smile lit up between flickering flames. I force a smile and blow out nine candles as my children gather around my bed, their smiles wide. 

I don‚Äôt even know their names. Their  father‚Äôs were dismembered in front of me. I can still feel each father‚Äôs blood, warm and slick on my skin. I can still hear their shrieks for mercy. I was taken as a *birther* when I was in college. 

*Birthers* are part of an ongoing epidemic of women being kidnapped by families who can not have children. 

Mrs. Tilsey was friends with my mom and has known me since *I* was a child. 

When she realized she was barren, Mrs Tilsey took matters into her own hands. 

Sometimes I can hear my mother upstairs, laughing. 

I wonder if she knows her missing daughter is down here. That her neighbor‚Äôs beautiful ‚Äòadopted‚Äô children are actually her own flesh and blood. 

The darkest parts of my mind whisper that *""Your mom always known! Who do you think recommended you?‚Äù* 

The first Daddy was Cam, a college varsity boy who sang me to sleep, promising we‚Äôd escape with *our* baby. 

But then he was shot through the head, his blood staining my blankets. 

His varsity jacket became part of me. Part of my *birthday.* 

Every father since wears it.

Jasper, wrapped in the  bloodied blue and gold jersey, says nothing, only tucking a strand of my hair behind my ear. He is yanked from the bed, the chains around his wrists jingling. I don't scream when his throat is slit open. 

Mrs. Tilsey is very surgical and precise with her kills, her eyes never leaving my bulging stomach carrying her child. 

Six hours later, I‚Äôm screaming, trying to find Jasper‚Äôs hand, but he‚Äôs gone. 

His body is already in a trash bag, being dragged from the room. I give birth to a beautiful little girl. Mrs. Tilsey snatches her away. When I wake up the next day, a new father is curled up next to me, wearing the letterman jacket. 

He‚Äôs already drugged, kissing my neck. 

In the doorway, Mrs. Tilsey watches, rocking my baby in her arms.

We‚Äôve been talking about marriage and rings recently, but now I‚Äôm questioning marrying someone who would send me a lame ass article like this. 

Article:

After her mailbag debut Jennifer, an Auburn fan from suburban Nashville, wanted to write an entire column for how wives can keep their husbands happy. 

Yes, she is real.

Now she has advice for all married women. 

...

A couple of weeks back, I wrote into the mailbag asking if I was the only wife giving her husband a weekly blowjob. Most people thought I was a blowjob deprived husband writing in hopes of his wife seeing it and somehow getting on board with the idea. Some commenters thought I was not real and another asked how big the diamond would have to be for me to leave my husband and marry him. Well, I got news for you, diamonds are not my thing, my husband is. If a girl insists on having a big diamond, that should be the first clue to get out while you still can. Anyway, I assure you I am real, and I have been married for 16 years and been with my husband for 20 years. I keep him happy from what I can tell, and now I will share 13 of the ways I do that.

LEARN MORE

1. Give him a blowjob at least once a week. This is not hard to do. It does not have to be the same day every week, but do it when the mood strikes you. He would be more than happy to come home from a long day of work to a blowjob. Trust me. And any man who says he doesn‚Äôt like blowjobs either had a bad experience or is married to someone who won‚Äôt give them. What a shame. As I said before ladies, put it in your mouth and tell me it doesn‚Äôt change your life. And, most men will agree, you need to swallow. If you don‚Äôt swallow, you need to learn how.

Spitters are quitters.

2. Give it up more often. Sleeping with your husband should not be work. It should be pleasure. I trust you have all heard, ‚ÄúThe way to a man‚Äôs heart is through his stomach.‚Äù Your mom and/or grandmother have told you this for years. Your mother-in-law told you the same thing when you and your husband got engaged. But she wasn‚Äôt sleeping with him. Don‚Äôt listen to them. This is false. This is the ‚ÄúBetter Homes and Gardens‚Äù version. The real way to a man‚Äôs heart is through sex. He would be happier to have KFC and a blowjob or sex than homemade rosemary chicken with two sides and fresh baked bread and a wife too tired to give it up.

3. Step up your sex game. Put on some slutty clothes and tell him you have been a bad girl. Send him text messages telling him what a dirty girl you are. My husband is probably pretty satisfied with our sex life because we put effort into it. I have said yes to everything he has wanted to try that only involves two people. Step. It. Up.

4. Quit bitching! This would go a long way to keeping your husband happy. Does it really matter which way the toilet paper is on the roll as long as it is on there? Does it really matter if he hasn‚Äôt taken the trash out today? Are your hands broken? No? Well then be sure to put the new bag in the trash can so that it doesn‚Äôt slip down when you start putting trash in it. There is always ‚Äúthat wife‚Äù in the circle of friends who makes everyone uncomfortable because she is bitching all the time and just tears her husband apart over the stupidest things. Don‚Äôt be ‚Äúthat wife‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt know who that is, it is you. Stop. Now.

5. Let him look at other women. So he likes Kate Upton because she is hot. (Honestly, who doesn‚Äôt? She is pretty hot.) So what? Let him look at her. She is not going to swoop in and take your husband away to some magical land where all they do is bang it out all day. This is not going to happen. So let him look. Let him peep someone out at the mall. Is it really hurting you? No, especially since you were eye balling Channing Tatum in Magic Mike. Who cares where he gets his appetite as long as he comes home to eat.

6. Don‚Äôt use the kids as an excuse. We have three kids, with 9 years between the first and last. I have had little kids at home for a very long time. When I gave birth to all three of our kids and ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt available,‚Äù my mouth still was. The world doesn‚Äôt stop because you become parents. How did you get that way? This especially pertains to the stay at home moms. I work full time and I give a weekly blowjob. Plus, we bang it out a few times a week. Make it a priority. Don‚Äôt grow apart, grow together. I understand that things are hard and chaotic, but that is life. This means that sometimes, you have to get it in when you can fit it in.

7. Stop trying to change him. He married you hoping you would never change and you married him hoping he would. You thought he had ‚Äúpotential‚Äù to be a great father and husband someday. Goodness gracious. Stop! He is who he is and all you‚Äôre doing is fostering a feeling of ill will and resentment. You may think that he is accepting it and you are making headway. But what you should be doing is accepting him and giving him head.

8. Let him do the things he enjoys. I know, I sound crazy right? You have been home all week while he ‚Äúgot‚Äù to go out and earn a living so you should be able to have him on the weekends. Or you have worked all week too and the chores don‚Äôt do themselves. I get that you want to spend time with him. If you let him go out and enjoy his hobbies, he will appreciate that. If you let him go play a round of golf on Saturday morning, then he will come home Saturday afternoon ready and willing to hang out with you and the kids. He is out there all week grinding and working for your ungrateful ass and you can‚Äôt even let him get in a round of golf? Four hours and he is back at the house with you and the kids. If you can‚Äôt allow this, you really need to look within. Let him go.

9. Stop keeping score. Life is not a pissing contest. Who cares if you are right? Who cares how many times you have taken the trash out compared to the amount of times he has helped you with the laundry?You are not going to die and have God say ‚ÄúWell you were right 87% of the time and you did 97% more of the chores than your husband.‚Äù Get off your ass and take the trash out. Women are lucky that their husbands don‚Äôt have the kind of memory they do, because things would get really ugly.

10. Don‚Äôt be a ‚ÄúYoko‚Äù. Men get married to awful women who expect that they will drop all of their friends when they tie the knot. Or, at least the ones she doesn‚Äôt like. Stop breaking up the band. It is so much more fun to get involved in the stuff they do than to stand around and bitch about it (see #4). Don‚Äôt make your husband take his ball and go home. Go watch them make fools out of themselves or hell, play along. It will go a long way with his friends accepting you and feeling comfortable around you, which in turn, you may see a side of them you didn‚Äôt even realize was there.

11. Stop making him do shit he doesn‚Äôt want to do and go places he doesn‚Äôt want to go. Stop with the couples baby showers. Hell, I don‚Äôt even like to go to those things. No man wants to go to a baby shower. He didn‚Äôt even want to go to the baby shower for his own kids. The person who invented the couples shower should be shot. They have really messed it up for everyone. He also doesn‚Äôt want to go to birthday parties for kids he barely knows or weddings for people he has never met. (Functions for people at work are a little different because modern day office politics almost require attendance. However, those events should always have an open bar.) Stop having weddings and functions during big football games, The Masters, opening day of baseball or hunting or whatever else he wants to do. I have a friend who is pregnant. She is due in October. We are having her baby shower on September 13 because that is an open date for Auburn Football. Yes, I schedule things around football and you should too.

12. Be Cool. I realize that this may be the hardest part of all of this for you to do. It is a very broad statement but it really encompasses all of the ‚Äúintangibles‚Äù a man is really looking for in a mate. I have been considered the ‚Äúcool wife‚Äù for a while now. I have been invited to play golf, go to games, go out drinking, and other fun things that are generally considered ‚Äúguy stuff.‚Äù One of the reasons is I am a tomboy, but it is also because since I can‚Äôt beat them, I join them. I tell dick jokes and laugh when my husband and his friends do the same. I also know some of the jokes will be about me and I embrace it. I went to have lunch with my husband one Valentine‚Äôs Day. A couple of his boys asked him what he got me for Valentine‚Äôs Day. He said he got me a ‚Äúcockmeat sandwich.‚Äù They looked at me, expecting me to get mad. All I did was reply, ‚ÄúWhat can I say? I was hungry.‚Äù They started laughing and later told my husband that he had a cool wife and asked how someone like him got a girl that was cool and hot. I also allowed a bachelor party, complete with a keg and a stripper, to be held at my house. I left and didn‚Äôt care what happened as long as they didn‚Äôt burn the place down. When I got home, there was whipped cream on the entertainment center and beer spilled on my carpet. I asked if they had fun and when the carpet cleaner would be there in the morning. Then I kicked back a few drinks with them. That is how you play it cool.

13. If all else fails, sex will cure it all. If you find yourself struggling with any of the topics above, resort back to numbers 1 or 2. When he comes in after a long, grueling day at work, have a cold beer ready for him and tell him when the kids go to bed, you will give him a blowjob. There is nothing that giving him a little ass cannot cure. Ask him. All the men reading this are agreeing with me. Once, during an argument with my husband, I asked him if I went down on him right then, could we just let it go. He quickly agreed.

Ladies - that is how you keep your husband happy. Your husband is reading this right now nodding his head at everything I have written. If you don‚Äôt read Outkick (you are really missing out) your husband is now plotting on how he will get this article into your hands, channeling his inner Ralphie in ‚ÄúThe Christmas Story,‚Äù who put an ad for the Red Rider BB gun in his mother‚Äôs magazine. He wants you to see it because it could mean more blowjobs, more sex, and a nicer, less bitchy wife. That is marital bliss to men.",/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1fr4y2y/aio_to_bf_sending_me_article_13_ways_to_keep_your/

He got to visit and play with his sisters every once in a while.  He lived on a 100 acre farm with creeks and ponds and a human dad that spent most of his time in the woods.

We wanted to name you Playful but my dad overruled and named you Benny. 

You witnessed me graduate elementary school, middle school, high school, college, and start my post college life. Every memory I have of my childhood, you were around for. Just the other day I found some bite marks in a few old Legos, and I know you are the culprit. 

You loved your walks at grandmas where she would throw you treats like you were at a parade. You loved going up north to relax on the porch without a leash. And you loved sleeping with me every night at home. You even loved your new fur brother Finley when we introduced him 5 years ago. He was young and sassy, but you were patient and shared your favorite things with him, like your perch on the couch to watch over our driveway. I know he misses you every day because whenever I say your name, he perks up and goes to look out the window to see if you come home. 

You were an absolute tank Benny. Nothing could stop you but old age. Remember when you wandered off in the freezing night? Somehow you found your way to an old man‚Äôs porch a half mile away. I thought I‚Äôd never see you again and I collapsed when my mom walked in the door with you half frozen. You were such a tough guy up until the end.

As Russian losses in Ukraine surge, some military bloggers turn on Kremlin, military command

The Kremlin is facing a backlash from Russian military bloggers outraged at reports of specialist troops being sent to storm Ukrainian positions in order to maintain pressure on the front lines.

Facing a shortage of manpower and a pressing need to maintain the grinding advances in eastern Ukraine, Russia has reportedly been throwing some of its most skilled troops into mass infantry attacks, and at very high costs.

""The past four months have proved the costliest for Russian forces since the war began in 2022,"" a U.K. Military Intelligence report on Sept. 23.

3685,Lost my soulkitty (13) to lymphoma ,"Hi, you wonderful community of senior catholdersü•∞

I‚Äòve been lurking around here in this sub since May, when my soulkitty was diagnosed with lymphoma. It broke my heart when we found out and I thought, she would die within weeks. But she fought and we fought with and for her - weekly bloodbuilding infusions and daily steroids brought her fairly good life quality during the whole summerü•∞ within the last 2 weeks, I realized a decline in energy and appetite and then - not even 1 week after she had coughed  and eaten up completely her last üê≠ - she didn‚Äôt stand up in the morning, was very weak, but made it to the litter box in the basement.

I took her to the vet and - of course - he recommended euthanasia. I asked him, if I could take her home to enable my husband and my kids to say goodbye to her. We arranged a home euthanasia for the next day, 1 o clock and he said this was a very good time table. She got steroids and pain medicine and some electrolytes to make sure she is not in pain.

But - she deteriorated from hour to hourüò± it all went so quickly! She couldn‚Äôt even stand up in the evening, I took her into my bed, awaking every hour to check if she is still breathing. She was very lethargic the next day, hardly could held her head up and turned yellowish more an more (liver failure). I was all alone, crying and counting hours, minutes‚Ä¶

When the vet finally arrived she hardly realized it. Her eyes went from side to side being already more dead than alive. She was gone not even an minute after the infusion. It was very peaceful though.

I feei sort of guilty that I caused these last 24 hours and didn‚Äôt let her being euthanized right on Wednesday at the vet‚Äòsüò¢ I try to focus on the 13 amazing years of life that I gave her, full of love, joy and mice‚ò∫Ô∏è I love her so much and will miss her forever ‚ù§Ô∏è though, I am glad, she is not struggling anymore. I asked her to and hope so much, she will wait for me on the other side. See you there,  thank you for your love üåà üêà ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks to all these amazing people in this sub, that gave me so much guidance and support üôè

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 43 years old. I‚Äôve lost 38 lbs. on Zep while gaining 10.4 lbs of muscle. The left pic was taken 6/25, about 3 weeks into my Zep adventure. The other 3 (l-r) are from 7/30, 8/29, and today (9/28). I lost about 10 lbs. in 2 months via Noom before I got the courage to take my first shot. 

I‚Äôm eating 1200-1300 calories most days and tracking on LoseIt. For those curious about titration: I did one month each at 2.5, 5, and 7.5. I‚Äôm on Week 5 of 10 mg. No side effects other than very mild constipation ‚Äî which I get whenever eat meat, with or without Zep. Daily fiber gummies, Miralax, and magnesium gummies are more than enough to fix that. 

I also had an epic NSV this morning: I fit into a pair of size 14 jeans. Granted, they‚Äôre a particularly generous fit/cut, but I‚Äôm still counting it. I‚Äôm beginning to think that sub-200 could be a reality for me for the first time since early high school - i.e., over 25 years ago.

{So let those fight in the way of Allah who exchange the life of this world for the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the way of Allah and is killed or victorious - We will give him a great reward.}
God Almighty is true

His Eminence, the Master of Resistance, the righteous servant, has passed away to be with his Lord and to His pleasure as a great martyr, a heroic, daring, brave, wise, insightful, and faithful leader, joining the caravan of martyrs of the eternal, luminous Karbala in the divine, faith-based path in the footsteps of the prophets and martyred imams.
His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezbollah, has joined his great and immortal martyred comrades, whose path he led for nearly thirty years, during which he led them from victory to victory, succeeding the Master of the Martyrs of the Islamic Resistance in 1992 until the liberation of Lebanon in 2000 and to the glorious divine victory in 2006 and all the battles of honor and sacrifice, arriving at the battle of support and heroism in support of Palestine, Gaza, and the oppressed Palestinian people.

We offer our condolences to the Master of the Age (may God hasten his reappearance), the Guardian of the Muslims, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, may his shadow endure, the great authorities, the mujahideen, the believers, the nation of resistance, our patient and struggling Lebanese people, the entire Islamic nation, all the free and oppressed people in the world, and his honorable and patient family. We congratulate His Eminence the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may God be pleased with him, on receiving the highest divine medal, the Imam Hussein Medal, peace be upon him, fulfilling his most precious wishes and the highest ranks of faith and pure belief, as a martyr on the path of Jerusalem and Palestine. We offer our condolences and congratulations to his fellow martyrs who joined his pure and holy procession following the treacherous Zionist raid on the southern suburb.

The leadership of Hezbollah pledges to the highest, most sacred and most precious martyr in our journey full of sacrifices and martyrs that it will continue its jihad in confronting the enemy, in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defense of Lebanon and its steadfast and honorable people.

To the honorable mujahideen and the victorious and triumphant heroes of the Islamic Resistance, you are the trust of the martyred Sayyid, and you are his brothers who were his impregnable shield and the jewel in the crown of heroism and sacrifice. Our leader, His Eminence, is still among us with his thought, spirit, line, and sacred approach, and you are committed to the pledge of loyalty and commitment to resistance and sacrifice until victory.

3763,AITA for walking away from my husbands family after being made the scapegoat?,"So, I've been married to hubby for 25 years. About 5 years ago we were having a lot of problems. To the point where we separated. He decided to call his Mom (backstory on her is that she did not raise my husband, does not or has not really made much of an effort to be in his, or our children's lives)and he tells her all these really messed up things about me (EI: like I'm making porn, in a secret society trying to ruin him, cheating on him etc.) It was horrible. For my kids (teenagers at this time) and I both. I was in a country that I am not from. I had no family, few friends.... not a lot of money since it took 5 years just to get my Visa to work. So this was all bad. So, knowing I had nobody, his Mom and family decided to gang up on me. I got calls, emails and his sister even made posts about me. Completely blindsided because I thought we were all ok before this. At that point, to protect myself, my sanity and spirit, I decided to walk away from his family completely. Oh and his Mom also decided to talk trash about me to my own children.... my kids took it upon themselves to love her from a distance. Hubby and I worked it out (as much as you can when being accused of espionage against your husband.... and I'm not using that word to exaggerate he accused me of it) and are still together... but this time in our marriage is dark and hard still for me. I wrote his family off. 
Now, his sister is getting married. She invited him. Apparently, and reluctantly I was invited too.... I'm still very much so uncomfortable with being around them. However, even the mere mention of his family brings all this up again for us. It's a lot. I decided not to go and told him to go by himself because it's his family and It'll be too uncomfortable for everyone if I'm there I feel. I also feel like there's a lot being said to me and he's not really being honest about with me. Because he said that he could have not told me about the wedding at all and just went. But he was the better person and told me. Ummmmm wtf?! I'm actually ready to leave again and never look back. Kids are grown and moved out. I'd be fine.

3801,Got assaulted in an uber going home from work in Terwillegar.,"TW: Sexual assault

For context I am a trans woman living in the Terwillegar area. This post is just meant as a reminder that you HAVE to be careful and that if the vibes ever seem off, even slightly, you need to get out or at least start planning, don‚Äôt wait hoping they will listen to no like I did. Share your location with a friend, keep them updated and have a plan for if you need help. If I hadn‚Äôt been able to scrape together my brain and get the last minute of my assault on video this disgusting piece of shit trash man might still be out there. And if you are taking an uber home, I honestly recommend choosing a drop off point close to your home in a public area (if possible), I didn‚Äôt and he found out where I lived, I even have his wife trying to contact me. Luckily  with the evidence I got he was quickly arrested and charged the next day,, but without that I am not sure how it would have gone. Next paragraph is going to go into some detail about what happened, so please skip it if you feel uncomfortable!!

Tuesday night I left work around 7pm and went to the grocery store, I didn‚Äôt want to bus back with all that so I ordered an uber. I work in Windermere and live in Terwillegar so it should have been a quick and easy trip, but instead I was sexually assaulted in the uber on a dark street by my home. He wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer, was asking me so many uncomfortable questions,, which is where I should have contacted uber support. He stopped on a dark street, leaned into the back seat and apparently felt privileged to my body despite the 50 million times I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and pushed his hands away. I was so scared, genuinely thought I was going to die and felt like I couldn‚Äôt run away because he could probably chase me down,, and making him mad was the last thing I wanted to do. I tried so so hard to de-escalate the situation while my mind was in complete panic. He kept saying how he is into ‚Äúshemales‚Äù and about how ‚Äúlonely‚Äù and ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù he was. Being fetishized like that felt disgusting. I am not going to go into too many more details but it wasn‚Äôt,, great. I am kind of scared to leave my home now and I don‚Äôt drive, so not being comfortable taking uber/cabs now has been difficult and limiting. His wife even tried calling me the next night asking to talk about the situation, she must have pulled my number from uber. Like fucking unhinged behaviour. I wish I never knew he had a family.

I don‚Äôt know if typing that all out really serves a purpose, it might have just been for me to vent, but I hope it helps someone out there. Please just be safe, keep a friend updated, and be ready to plan an escape the second things seem weird. Don‚Äôt assume just because you are three minutes away from home that it will be okay. And if you feel safe enough to record, do it! Without my video he would probably still be out there. 

If anyone is dealing with a similar situation, please take the time to contact the sexual assault centre, they will help and hopefully provide the supports you need. I am not wildly educated when it comes to safety in these situations, but that is something I will be changing going forward. I just didn‚Äôt think it would happen. Please be safe out there.",/r/Edmonton/comments/1frjrlq/got_assaulted_in_an_uber_going_home_from_work_in/

3809,"[Krawczynski] Keeping him [KAT] on the roster likely would have meant saying goodbye to [Naz] Reid, who won NBA Sixth Man of the Year last season and is wildly popular in Minnesota, and likely Alexander-Walker as well, team sources said.","&gt;None of the messaging indicated a seismic move was imminent. After more than a year of the Knicks making overtures for Towns that were summarily dismissed by the Timberwolves because they were not good enough, many in Minnesota didn‚Äôt expect Rose and Gersson Rosas, the former president of basketball operations in Minnesota, who was fired and landed with the Knicks, to get serious about their pursuit.

&gt;If they were going to relent to New York‚Äôs wishes by finally giving them Towns, DiVincenzo had to be part of the package, team sources said. 

&gt;The two-for-one opens up more options for tweaking the roster going forward. Randle and DiVincenzo have much more tradeable contracts, and the shorter terms could give the Wolves a lot of leeway three years down the road. With Edwards rising near the top of the league, the Wolves like that part of the deal while also believing they can remain contenders for the season ahead.

&gt;Randle has plenty of advocates in Minnesota. The Wolves believe his bully-ball approach on offense can work with what they have around him. He is a solid passer as well and plays a physical style that appeals to Finch. The new combination of depth coupled with anticipated leaps from Edwards, McDaniels and Reid will be relied upon to help the Wolves boost their 17th-ranked offense.

&gt;Now the biggest question left to answer is if they are still a contender in the West this season. They believe that Randle‚Äôs bucket-getting and toughness and DiVincenzo‚Äôs shooting and defense give them a real chance. Training camp is right around the corner, so it won‚Äôt take long for the answers to emerge.

3815,AIW for Leaving My Husband After I Found Out He Cheated While I Was in the Hospital Giving Birth?,"so, i just had the most emotional rollercoaster of my life. i was in the hospital for a few days, giving birth to our first child, and during that time, i found out my husband i cannot even say his name anymore....... cheated on me.

i had a complicated labor, and there were moments i was really scared and vulnerable. while i was focused on bringing our baby into the world, jake was texting someone else behind my back. i discovered it when my sister came to visit and mentioned something that seemed off about his behavior. out of curiosity, i checked his phone while he stepped out of the room and found flirty texts with another woman.

i was devastated. how could he do this to me during such a critical time? i confronted him as soon as he returned, and instead of remorse, he made excuses, saying he felt neglected and alone while i was in the hospital. i was in shock‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt even try to deny it.

i ended up leaving the hospital a day after giving birth, and i took the baby to my parents‚Äô house. jake has been trying to apologize and convince me to come back, but i feel so betrayed. some friends say i‚Äôm overreacting and that we can work through this, but i just can‚Äôt see how i can trust him again.

in a nutshell: aia for leaving my husband after i found out he cheated while i was in the hospital giving birth?

i found out my husband cheated on me while i was in the hospital having our baby. i left him and now feel betrayed.

In reflection, I am just proud. It hasn‚Äôt been an easy year with dealing with my mental health ( anxiety) but I know alcohol would continue to  contribute to anxiety. 

I don‚Äôt have just one reason I stopped drinking but I am glad I did.

One person flat out told me the news reporting I40 being washed out was a lie and we are just using ""not being able to get to the buildings"" as an excuse to be lazy. 

Another person told me they understand the storm did a lot of damage and ruined a lot of lives, and they feel bad for people but ""what does that have to do with me"" as if the storm didn't hit them too.

But the real bombshell was at the very end, in a blink and you'll miss it add-on. I thought it deserved its own thread because it is not mentioned in the other post and if people dont listen to the very, very end they'll miss it.

Canada's invictus wants harry by himself in 2025 because Meghan is too demanding and..... they don't like way she dresses! It is too vulgar, and the journo mentions explicitly how Meghan wore short shorts in front of soldiers who had lost their legs . I wonder if this is also the reason for all his recent solo appearances, she is NFI.

I know sometimes people can lose fame, or one partner drifts off into oblivion after a divorce. But this is the first time I can remember in a celeb couple when just one spouse in an existing power couple gets blacklisted and drifts off into oblivion, while remaining married to a spouse who continues to be A-list. 

It can be heard at the 29:50 mark of this video.

oh my god. I am losing my mind over this dress. I can't sleep at night. I can't focus at work. I can't think about anything else. I know it sounds insane, but I can't help it. Literally the prettiest thing I've ever seen in my life and I cannot find it no matter what I do. i need it for my wedding dress. it's my dream dress. Please please please help me find this dress !!!!! 

 It's called the Free People Nightingale Dress.
I need it in Cream/White, a Medium or Large. i would potentially take a small if i have to, will just have to loose some weight before the wedding. which im willing to do if i must. idc how much it costs. has to be available for purchase. im not interested in sold or unavailable listings pls. pictured above.

 i'm getting married in a few months and I wanted to use this as my wedding dress. I know it's not traditional, but we want to do kind of a more casual kind of hippie, fairy ceremony in the woods with flowers and stuff and this is literally my dream dress. Like when I saw it for the first time, it looks exactly like what I pictured myself wearing in my dream wedding. 
and I cannot find anything that's even close to similar to it. I really need help. i've found one in purple and one in rose, but i need the white color. it's gonna be a wedding dress it's gotta be the white version.

Every single person I see stocking shelves in Walmart is a migrant.

And no, it is not because no one would do the job, it is because they are paying them minimum wage and they reduced all the other peoples hours until they had to quit because they are on a higher payscale.

Yes, you have been duped by corporately backed media to ruin the lives of the most vulnerable US citizens in this country.

This is subsidized cheap labor imported on the US taxpayers dime to fill minimum wage roles, because no one can work for minimum wage in this country anymore.

A living wage in the US is 31 dollars an hour on a full time job for a single person. We have serious problems.

To the doubters : Welcome to Reality.

4032,My sexual harassment was brushed aside at work until money was involved,"I work at a library. Since June I've had a regular patron make unwanted advances toward me. The first couple of times I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I figured he's just a lonely old man with no social awareness. But it's been consistent. He's told me that if I smile the day would be much better, commented about my tattoos, said blond was a good color on me, asked a coworker if I was married, asked another coworker where I was when I was out one day. He gets visibly excited when he sees me. He doesn't say these things to any other staff members. I've reported all of these incidents to my boss assuming they would do something. 

I went on FMLA in July and my managers decided then to talk to security about what's going on, not even considering getting my input, and I wasn't able to at that time anyway. Security said the next time he does something they'll talk to him. But they still haven't talked to him. And still nobody ever asked to hear my side of the story.

Yesterday that patron didn't have enough money to pay for his prints, for the third time. My coworker told our department head and they immediately called her to come and talk to security and they said next time he comes in they'll talk to him. That upset me because they haven't taken my sexual harassment seriously at all.

I confronted my department head about it yesterday and she said they didn't talk to me about it because they didn't want to ""upset"" me. I'm only upset that they're not doing anything. She also said, out loud, to me, that she didn't see him as a problem patron until he stopped paying his fees, and that that made it ""real"" for her. I'm still in shock over that statement. It's so callous and inappropriate and invalidating. I feel like my discomfort in the face of several rule violations over 4 months wasn't taken seriously because the department wasn't losing money. $13, by the way.

In the end I talked to security and the director of the library and they finally agreed, after hearing my story, that he's past verbal warnings and needs to be suspended. I don't have a ton of faith that that will happen. I feel like I can't trust my managers or really anyone in the building. I almost quit yesterday but I don't have any other income. I don't know what to do, but I want there to be at least some acknowledgement that their conduct was inappropriate at best. I'm pissed off. And I don't know where to go from here (I am applying for other jobs).",/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1frf6qa/my_sexual_harassment_was_brushed_aside_at_work/

4038,Rented a Model 3. I get why rental companies are dumping Teslas.,"Preface: I own a Model Y and I love it. Best car I've ever owned.

Had to go to Albuquerque for a short 2-day business trip. Rented a compact car from Budget. Guy asked how far I'd be driving, I said almost none, staying in airport area. He asked if he can give me a Tesla, I said sure. He told me it was a Y, but it was actually a RWD 3 with the LFP pack.

After getting in the car, ALL the settings were jacked up. Screen on Light rather than auto, headlights on rather than auto, climate manual not auto. Random safety features turned off. Autopilot set to TACC-only (although I get that). Sentry on. Bunch of other ones I forget, but I had to fix almost every setting. Luckily battery was at 98% so thats good. Unlike Hertz, Budget does not allow app connectivity, just the card.

I drove away and attended a meeting for a few hours. Came back out to the A/C humming away, I had missed the cabin overheat protection setting, it drained 10% of the battery in the hot New Mexico sun. Luckily I only used 20% of the battery my whole trip because I stayed pretty local. Car was also sort of janky: really bad wind noise/gap in driver window somewhere, and suspension felt a little rattle-y compared to my Y. Car had 21k miles. However I was impressed with the power of the RWD model. It's totally adequate, if not impressive.

Anyway, the ONLY reason I was able to navigate all this is because I own a Tesla and I know all this stuff. I cannot imagine any non-Telsa-owner being able to figure all this out and being happy with the experience. And I didn't even have to figure out how/where to charge it, that would be a whole other ball of wax for a new person. Beyond depreciation, I bet they've gotten tons of user complaints on these.

So that's my rant. Thanks for reading.",/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1frg26x/rented_a_model_3_i_get_why_rental_companies_are/

We have experimented with sounding (inserting objects into the urethra) and I recently purchased a box of those silicone sensory toys that are these brightly colored silicone noodles. They are about 12 inches long and maybe 5/16 of and inch thick, really stretchy and soft. I thought ""Hell, I bet that would feel interesting"" so I tried it out. 

Long story short, the noodle was long enough to breach my bladder, which was fine. Then I started losing my erection which caused it to slide deeper in until I couldn't grab it and it completely disappeared. I tried for a bit to massage it out but it kept going further in until I couldn't feel it anywhere anymore. 

Panic set in a bit and I went to see if I could still pee. All was well... Decided to bang one out (for science) and came just fine. 

Okay, the things gotta be in my bladder. I spent the next hour thinking things through, googled and concluded I would have to go to the ER. 

Texted the wife and explained what happened. 

About 2 hours later we were in the ER. My wife was great and did most of the talking. I was pretty embarrassed and tripped over my words so it was nice letting her at least get the ball rolling. Overall everyone was really nice, they treated me respectfully and only had a few questions about the why and how. 

Ended up having a urologist go in with a Cystoscope and pull it out. It was actually not bad - all things considered. 

Anyways, if you ever plan to put something in your body make sure it can't get sucked in! Pretty basic...

Tldr: I put a silicone noodle sensory toy in my penis and it went into my bladder (all the way). Had to go to the ER and have it removed via Cystoscope. ",/r/tifu/comments/1frmovy/tifu_by_inserting_a_silicone_noodle_onto_my/

I don't even know if Poppy should really count, she only uses hers for her passive and it's more a buckler than a shield. Same with Singed, his is only visual and to reinforce the fantasy of him running towards your team head first. Only Braum, Leona and Pantheon do use their shields for abilities and the idea of shield = protection. Shouldn't Riot create more champions that actually use shields and are a core part of their identity? Or at least have them as a ""defensive stance"" ala Rell.

I‚Äôve been a watch enthusiast for quite some time, and I thought it would be fun to share a bit about my collection with you all. Each timepiece I own carries its own unique story, filled with moments of joy and nostalgia.

My oldest watch is the Rolex Submariner ‚ÄúKermit‚Äù flat four. I still remember the thrill of acquiring it‚Äîthe vibrant green bezel instantly caught my eye, and it‚Äôs been a staple on my wrist ever since. This watch has been with me through countless adventures, adding a touch of style to everyday moments and special occasions alike.

Fast forward to my latest addition: the Omega Speedmaster ‚ÄúSnoopy‚Äù edition. This one brings a smile to my face every time I glance at it. The playful Snoopy design adds a bit of whimsy to my collection and serves as a cheerful reminder to enjoy the lighter side of life. It‚Äôs quickly become a favorite for both its aesthetics and the good vibes it brings.

Collecting these watches has been more than just a hobby; it‚Äôs a journey filled with happy memories and personal milestones. Each piece marks a chapter in my life, from exciting new beginnings to simple moments of contentment.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckHOA/comments/1fjuhxj/hoa_freaks_out_over_black_suvs_at_birthday_party/)**: September 18, 2024**

The email I just received from HOA. The people in the SUV were regular people who were my friends. This is just weird. Am I supposed to tell those people to rent a Prius the next time around?

FYI this was a very tame party. No loud music. About 6 vehicles in the driveway and 2 on the street and everyone parked in a decent manner.

***Email Transcription***

Dear \[redacted\]

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out regarding an incident that occurred over the weekend during your birthday party. A few of us in the community couldn't help but notice the arrival of three blacked-out SUVs, which quite frankly, startled and unsettled several of your neighbors.

It's really concerning to see such vehicles showing up in our otherwise peaceful, family-oriented neighborhood, especially without any prior notice. As you can imagine, the sight of them raised a lot of questions and caused quite a bit of anxiety. Some residents even thought something more serious was happening. The whole situation was, quite honestly, alarming, and we had no idea how to react.

We all understand celebrating special occasions, but in the future, we would appreciate it if you could let us know in advance about any unusual activity. It would certainly help ease the collective nerves of your neighbors, who were left feeling quite uncomfortable by the presence of those vehicles.

Please let us know if there's anything you can do to avoid similar concerns going forward. We trust you'll be considerate of the community's feelings moving forward.

Best regards,

\[redacted\]

\[redacted\] HOA Vice President

***Some of OOP's Comments and some top comments:***

Commenter: Ok, here is what you do. Get more friends. Get everyone to dress in suits, except one guy. Maybe two. Load them into the suvs. Drive to the community like before. Everyone who looks the same quickly exits the vehicles. They look around, point at things. The ones that are different get out after and walk to the door. After they are in the home, everyone else quickly rushes into the home.

&gt;**OOP**: Lmao

Commenter: Tell her The Donald came to the party and those where his secret service agents

&gt;**OOP:** Funny enough, one of the guest‚Äôs name was donald.

*In response to some ideas:*

&gt;As much as I would like to be a dick to them. I would rather be polite and avoid annoying little issues that they will likely come up with if I wasn‚Äôt.

Commenter: Were they even blacked out, or just your standard suburban family black SUV with slightly tinted rear windows?

&gt;**OOP:** They were blacked out fully tinted. 2 Tahoes and one Grand Cherokee. The owners of these vehicles are lovely people. I feel like there are stereotypes related to blacked out vehicles that aren‚Äôt always true. But still it should be nobody‚Äôs business.

Commenter: ""Anything you can do""

Hoa should change its name to nna (nosy neighbors association)

&gt;**OOP:** I mean I thought I was doing a lot just by keeping the noise down. I went out to the street several times to make sure everyone was parked appropriately. apparently that‚Äôs not enough.

Commenter: So white SUVs would‚Äôve been okay, presumably? üòÇüòÇ

&gt;**OOP:** I guess? Lol what horseshit lies in these people‚Äôs minds I could never imagine. Probably just stereotypes of black SUV from movies and tv shows they watch  
(to another commenter): I think some people take crime tv shows and movies too seriously while a person in a corolla might as well be a gang leader. Its absurd.

*Is it actually a rule?*

&gt;Currently I dont think there are any rules about blacked out vehicles but I think after this they might just put it on the list.

***Top Comment on Post:***

**GeneralTonic:** To whom it concerns,

You recently contacted me to disclose your anxious reaction to our birthday guests. Your concerns are baseless, unwarranted, and frankly, embarrassing. Please do not do contact me again regarding this kind of private emotional issue, as I am unqualified to help you.

Yours, \[homeowner\]

*\[Editor's note: there are lots of funny ideas in the comments on the Original Posts on what OOP should do if you feel like having a laugh.\]*

**Mini Update**

Update: The HOA found this post. Im just going home now and will post the updated email follow up they sent me. I think they got the message. So far 4000+ people commented.

*Editor's note: The post went semi-viral and has reached 44K upvotes as of this post*

**Full** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckHOA/comments/1fjuhxj/comment/lnsyszw/) **Update: 10 hours later**

My response to my HOA: It‚Äôs hard to believe you‚Äôd be this cooperative and apologetic without the 6,000 Redditors who weighed in. Let this serve as a clear message to you and any other HOA ‚Äúleaders‚Äù stop with the nonsense. If even 1/100th of the people commenting here knew who you insufferable folks are, they‚Äôd troll you endlessly and make your so called inclusive and welcoming neighborhoods a nightmare.

Sincerely, A friend of the black SUV owners.

*Email transcription:*

Dear \[redacted\]

I'm reaching out after one of our HOA members brought to my attention the Reddit post about the email I sent regarding your birthday party. After reviewing the post and seeing the overwhelming response, I can completely understand why my original message was seen as alarmist, demeaning, and even offensive. I want to publicly apologize to you and anyone else who felt the same. That was never the intention, and I deeply regret how the email was worded.

The feedback highlighting how my email was seen as inappropriate and offensive is completely understandable, and I sincerely apologize for that. Our community strives to be inclusive and welcoming, and I recognize that my message did not reflect those values.

I also ask, in the interest of privacy, that you kindly refrain from revealing any personal information about our HOA members in your Reddit post, as that could lead to significant privacy issues for individuals in our community. We want to handle this situation responsibly and avoid any further complications.

Moving forward, we are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive neighborhood, and I appreciate your understanding as we work to make this right.

4141,Beatrice's Dislike for Anne Frank May Be Deeper Than We Thought,"I was rewatching Bojack Horseman the other day for the twelfth time and a few details stuck in my head. Now I'm referring to Beatrice's comment about Anne Frank. **""It takes a real narcissist to think anyone would want to read a book about them. You know how I feel about Anne Frank.""** It may just be a dark humor joke (a very good one), but watching the rest of the series this may have more depth.

Despite Beatrice's poor relationship with Joseph in *""Time's Arrow""*, she has a high regard for her father, describing him as **""a man who knew what marriage meant""** despite lobotomizing his wife Honey. At his funeral, she looks very mournful, so she loved him to a certain degree, and being the only parent she had left after lobotomizing Honey, they must've been close. Even in the same episode she internalizes her father‚Äôs misogynistic comments regarding her weight as truth, replicating this years later with Hollyhock.

My point is that Beatrice respected Joseph and accepted what he believed as truth, not having another adult to teach her how the world works. And it's Joseph who in *""The Old Sugarman Place""*, upon returning to the lake house to get Crackerjack's blanket, says: **""If anyone's to blame it's the Jews for peeving off Hitler so bad!""** regarding his son's death. Again, another dark humor joke, but it got me thinking.

Being a little girl and believing everything her father says, Beatrice may have internalized this as truth, that WW2 was the Jews' fault. Hence, Beatrice sees the Jews as the ones to blame for her brother's death, so she doesn't think of them as victims, but as evil perpetrators. The Diary of Anne Frank came out when Beatrice was 9-years-old and she must've read it as a pre-teen or perhaps she never read it. So, seeing that a Jewish girl became famous for a book about herself made her believe that Anne Frank was an evil narcissist who took advantage of the war to become famous, because the Jews were to blame for everything. Beatrice truly believes that Anne Frank was a narcissist.

Chick-O-Stick is a candy produced by the Atkinson Candy Company that has been manufactured since the 1950s. It is made primarily from peanut butter, cane sugar, corn syrup, toasted coconut, natural vanilla flavor, and salt with no hydrogenated oils or artificial preservatives added.

Chick-O-Stick's original wrapper design featured a stylized cartoon of a chicken wearing a cowboy hat and a badge in the shape of the Atkinson logo. The chicken is absent from the more recent wrapper; some commentators have indicated that it contributed to confusion over whether the Chick-O-Stick was candy or a chicken-flavored cracker. 

The Atkinson Candy Company's website states that one of their sales representatives just ""came up with the name one day, and well, it just stuck."" The company had once written in correspondence that they felt the Chick-O-Stick resembled ""fried chicken"" and that contributed to the name.",/r/nostalgia/comments/1frme03/chickostick/

4286,Unpopular opinon: Rose wasn't wrong about Spinel,"Both Pink and Spinel were childish. You can't give one responsibility of a child to another child. If someone was to blame for Spinel, then it would just be the diamonds. They have neglected a whole ecosystem of gems and their emotinal needs.

They assigned Spinel to keep Pink busy, and created her for a sole purpose, ignoring her senses of individuality. Pink was in fact burdened with another pesence to take care off, just how Steven suffered with having to take care of everyone even though he was a child..

Everyone empathizes with Steven, but ignores Pink's sentiment. Honestly, whenever you watch Steven, you should compare the gems to family dynamics,

Here, the situation is as if the parents gave the elder sister the responsibility of her younger sister ignoring the fact that the older sister would have desires other than that, 

There's something that's actually pretty common and called ""eldest sister syndrome"" where the person feels constant anxiety, has a lack of boundaries and develops a people-pleasing persona as a result to the responsibilities they were given when they were in a very early age,

I am pretty sure leaving Spinel shaped a lot of personality traits in Rose, who I can't blame for she was new too",/r/stevenuniverse/comments/1fre3kw/unpopular_opinon_rose_wasnt_wrong_about_spinel/

I saved the 3 babies and made a temp enclosure and have been syringe feeding them for the past 3 days. It‚Äôs also cold asf here so my thoughts were, they‚Äôd probably have a better chance with me than in the yard with no protection. They would‚Äôve been eaten by any of my 4 neighbors dogs. Anyway. They‚Äôve all eaten well and are grooming themselves and each other, as well as myself. They also do the happy shakes when I put my hand in their enclosure and are not at all scared of me. I know most likely they are gunna die but when do I have to not worry about that? ",/r/Animal/comments/1frhcn8/my_dogs_found_a_nest_in_the_middle_of_our_yard/
4288,"I hate gatekeeping other people, but I have been tempted recently.","I hate gatekeeping other people. As someone who faces a LOT of stereotypes and assumptions, I hate the idea of gatekeeping in any form.

In board game meets, I try to be as accommodating as possible. I develop systems to teach people the rules, get them engaged and help them along the way. I haven't won a certain tactical game in a while, because I spend my brainpower assisting new players.

The most complex game I bring to meets is at BGG complexity rating of 2.3. I don't enjoy super complex and long games.  I imagine that players who love those complex games could call me a ""casual,"" so I wouldn't do the same with newcomers.

But certain incidents I had are tempting me to reconsider.

Imagine you are in a table with 3-4 people who got the rules teach and ready to go. Then a person intrudes and ask to join (And they are always people who come late).  You, as the welcoming person, say sure. You leave a room to sit and give a teach again using the system that you honed over many months and has always been successful.

That new person then proceeds to complain all the way through the game about how complex it is. And later it turns out that they haven't even been listening to the teach. This brings the whole mood of the table down.  The person then insists that I bring out a simpler game for that them.  Of course, they didn't bring their own game. Apparently, you were supposed to prepare an Uno-level game for them when you show up to these meets, even though you don't know them.

Since everyone at the table is trying to be nice and not gatekeep either, it becomes a race to the bottom to the absolute simplest games. And it gets worse as the person starts increasing demands. ""I don't like bluffing games."" ""I don't like games where you have to count.""  ""I don't like negotiations."" So on and so forth.

Sometimes I explain before they sit down that this is a tactical game, or takes 45mins etc. They say they are fine (Of course they do. They are not listening to you), and the same thing happens again.

It happened more than a few times and ruined many game nights.

I used to say to myself that this must be a one-off, but it happened enough times that I think ""are some people coming in just to be a spoil-sport?""

So what do we do if we want to enjoy Through the Desert (Yes. That level of simplicity) after many weeks of putting it off? Just say no to people who haven't played with you before? I am there to enjoy myself, and not provide volunteer services to help people.  But that could also lead to excluding people who would genuinely love learning about good games.

If this scenario has never happened to you, then that means I just need to keep looking for better meetups. ",/r/boardgames/comments/1frkaku/i_hate_gatekeeping_other_people_but_i_have_been/

She doesn't speak in that overly snarky, mannered modern sitcom way. As she talks about helping Eve with the baby, it feels very natural. Watch her facial expressions as she listens and reacts to others. She doesn't do this exaggerated mugging. I believed this was Roz offering to take an exhausted mother on a girls' night out, not a sitcom character speaking halting sentences with pauses for laughs.

I discovered the next night that he had not noticed or removed the STRIP OF PAPER that lines the bottom of each slice, which likely contributed to his not really enjoying the brioche.

4372,"If you don't see my value, I'll leave!","I was just reminded of this story today because I ran into the person (antagonist) in this story:

Years ago I worked at a business with many departments. The department I worked in had a lot of recent turnover and suddenly I became the most experienced person in that area. Being young and female, not a lot of people took me seriously but I was ready and willing to change their minds and excited to succeed.

A few weeks in I catch word the company has sent someone who I considered a friend, let‚Äôs call them Shelby, from another department to another location to train for‚Ä¶..my position!

I confront the manager, cry (because I‚Äôm young and very heartbroken they still aren‚Äôt taking me seriously) and begin formulating my plan.

I found another company in the city that was hiring something similar. I had to do some studying and pass a test first though.

During that time Shelby has come back, knows I know, and is utterly sorry for betraying me etc.etc. I barely talk to her. She eventually informs me she has decided to resign and I simply say, good luck (knowing I‚Äôll be leaving soon after).

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I‚Äôm feeling confident in my studies and am ready to give my notice, but I wait, until the day after Shelby‚Äôs last day‚Ä¶.ahhhh it felt so good to tell them I was leaving especially after the person who they were trying to replace me with was already gone.

Just ran into the manager today and was glad to tell them I am now in the highest position of the company I went to work for after they failed to see my value.",/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1frqzd8/if_you_dont_see_my_value_ill_leave/

4376,Discussion about the Doctors relationships: ,"So I‚Äôve seen this floating around the internet and it made me think, I am of the opinion that 1) true love with one person isn‚Äôt really possible, 2) he experienced something like that with both women, 3) neither were more loved than the other and if Rose had returned sometime after he married River she would be the one that got away rather than him possibly running to rekindle and expand a romance that never had the chance to bloom. 

I always think the argument of who was more loved, who the Doctor would choose if they were both in a room, is a hard one because he loved them equally as much during their time together. Yet, I do also think that he had more time to develop a semi-not-really-but-maybe-just-a-bit-stronger-relationship with River by the time they got married (however disjointed by time it was).

 I‚Äôm interested to know what other fans think of this, outside of preferences, favorable ‚Äúships‚Äù. What do you actually think would happen if Rose had come back during 11‚Äôs run while River was a big part of his life? Do you think he‚Äôd honor what he had or what was building with River or try to salvage what could‚Äôve been with Rose? ",/r/doctorwho/comments/1frkejh/discussion_about_the_doctors_relationships/

And yeah, there‚Äôs some hard games coming up, Oklahoma is probably going to lose some of them, but that‚Äôs okay. BV has had a Top 10 recruiting class every year since he took over. This team is going to be just fine going into the future.

4438,Got marked as a No Call No Show because no one told me I was scheduled to come in at 7am on a Saturday until 2 hours before my shift started.,"I got woken up at 7:40 this morning to a call from my work saying that I'd been marked as a ncns for not showing up to a surprise morning shift that no one even told me I was scheduled for... until 2 hours before my shift started.

Apparently there's a new rule they didn't disclose that we're required to work one Saturday shift a month. I've worked here 3 months now and that was never a thing before, no one mentioned this to me. I didn't even know we were fucking open on Saturdays. When I signed up we were explicitly NOT open weekends. I'm genuinely wondering if this is some sort of retaliation for me putting in my 2 weeks notice the other day. Now I'm considering rescinding that offer and quitting on the spot but I'm too tired to make that decision right now. 

I've never worked a morning shift for them, EVER. My regular shift is 3:40PM-7:40PM and I occasionally work doubles starting at the same time and going until 12:10AM. Why the hell they thought I'd be down for a morning shift is beyond me; maybe they only have morning shifts on Saturdays. I was too bleary-eyed and in a confused panic to ask very many questions.

I don't know how they expected me to reasonably see that notification in time to come in to work, who the hell recreationally wakes up at 5 or 6 am on a Saturday?? Not me at least. This never even showed up in the list of schedule requests the work app sends out a few weeks prior to a shift. Literally the first I was notified of any of this was 5am this morning, according to my notification bar. At which point I was asleep.

TL;DR: Got woken up at 7:40 this morning to a call from my work saying that I'd been marked as a ncns even though no one told me about my shift. My bad for being asleep at 5am on a Saturday, I guess.",/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1frg35y/got_marked_as_a_no_call_no_show_because_no_one/

I (19F) am a manager in a fast food restaurant. It‚Äôs pretty miserable, but anyone who works in food service knows you just slip into that customer service personality to ignore how miserable it can be. I didn‚Äôt have the energy to do that during this shift.

One of the guys I was in charge of was on the register, lets call him James, and he‚Äôs usually a very non-confrontational guy (keep this in mind) and he‚Äôs always on my shifts so we‚Äôre pretty good friends. Here‚Äôs what happened:

James: *Finishes taking this guys order* If you don‚Äôt mind, could you fill out the survey on the bottom of your receipt for a coupon?

Weird Customer: Thanks! Tell that girl (me) behind you that she needs to smile more, or I‚Äôm gonna mention that on the survey.

Seeing as I had just gotten a call that my dad was in the hospital and was possibly going into an inpatient facility, I lost it. I just started crying and went in the back to calm down. That was until I heard James say this: 

‚ÄúDude, she just found out her dad tried to kill himself, and she can‚Äôt go see or talk to him because she‚Äôs stuck here, with people like you who say obnoxious shit like that.‚Äù 

Watching that guy‚Äôs face completely drop, and very guiltily walk out of the building on the security camera footage almost made me forget about my dad‚Äôs suicide attempt.

4490,"üß° A update on Red, the cat who was dumped. He found his forever home! üéâ","Previous post: [Link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/s/CqfGL9GqyR)

UPDATE! Red is SAFE and in a forever home! He no longer will be living on the streets. No longer will go to sleep hungry, have to worry where his next meal will come from, where a safe place to rest his head will be, protecting himself from predators and cruel people... he's safe. And he's the happiest I've ever seen him in the entire 2 months he was living in my mobile home park. He always walked around with a an exhausted and despaired look on his face, and who could blame him? He doesn't have to worry about any of that now. He found his people, he found HIS home. So many people rooted for him, and those positive thoughts and wishes worked in his favor. Red truly deserved this amazing outcome. ü•π

I want to thank everyone for caring so much about this sweet boy and for being so patient regarding my responses to know if it all ended well. It definitely did. He lucked out with the perfect home, and it truly couldn't have been a better match. Between networking to find Red an adopter/or foster, coordinating transport, communicating with the amazing TNR caretaker who offered to board him for a week while I figured out a plan, and caring for a TNR'd feral for a week + a one-eyed cat for 5 days who was just picked up by the rescue this morning and is being transported 6 hours to his foster home... plus caring for 5 of my own... it's been a bit chaotic! But it paid off and my heart is full and happy, as I'm sure so many people will feel the same way once they see this video of him in his new home.

This is why rescue is so important, as well as spaying and neutering. To promise that each cat, especially the ones dumped/abandoned, find their forever home and can leave a lasting imprint on so many lives. Please consider adopting from your local county shelter or fostering a cat from your nearest rescue, and don't forget to spay and neuter your pets. If you can no longer keep an animal due to personal circumstances, reach out for help. It's out there, I promise. Don't dump them and leave them to survive on their own, because chances are they won't make it very long. Together we can make a world of a difference for so many.

Love you, Red. May you enjoy your new home, you sweet beautiful orange boy!

Now the problem is, there were 1-2 times when my partner wasn‚Äôt in the mood, but agreed to have sex still, didn‚Äôt show or tell me he doesnt want it, and then just‚Ä¶either couldn‚Äôt get an erection, or got soft halftime. This week this happened again, I didn‚Äôt have a clue, I was super excited and turned on, and then‚Ä¶we couldn‚Äôt even start it. 

Previously, I always took it easy and tried to lighten the mood to comfort him, since I know it very well that the situation hurt and embarrased him too (he feels like its his fault). But this time, I feel like something died inside me. I just grabbed my clothes, hurried to the bathroom and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I feel bad for this too, Im sure I just made the situation even worse and hurt him but at that moment, I just couldn‚Äôt pull myself together.

First of all, I just feel like‚Ä¶.so fucking ugly, you know? Like, I know that the whole ‚Äúmen always want sex and would fuck anything with a hole on it‚Äù is bullshit, but‚Ä¶I just tought if your loved one is naked, wants you, kissing you, touching you, rubbing herself against you etc. would do the trick. Well, it doesn‚Äôt. And I just don‚Äôt know what am I doing wrong. I hear stories from my friends that they just take off their shirts and their men are sooo happy and almost ready. And then, there‚Äôs me‚Ä¶I cant even find the right words for how I feel about this. Objectively, I know that I am a perfectly average-looking woman with good hygene, but now, I feel like something must be terribly wrong with me. Like, how disgusting you must be if even your husband doesnt want you? How  foolish and pathetic I must have been looked, with all my one-sided excitement and happiness and desire? In the past, I was almost ‚Äúproud‚Äù of how much I like sex, but now I just feel like some disgusting, creepy person who tries too hard and didnt even notice herself.

And secondly, I feel like all my trust in myself and in my partner is gone. It wasn‚Äôt the first time this happened. I kindly said that please, just turn me down if you dont want it. He said he will. And yet here we are. He didn‚Äôt stopped me, moreover, it was his idea to have sex to begin with. Now, all I can think of that next time, how the hell would I know if he really wants me? I can imagine myself thinking: ‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs just acting like it? What if he‚Äôs not even into it, just somehow managed to get hard? Am i a burden right now? Am I a duty? Does he think of something so he could stay hard, because we all know that all I have is not enough for that?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want him to fuck me if he doesnt want to, its horrifying, feels like im r@ping him‚Ä¶but now I feel like i can never be sure whats happening. 

I dont want anyone to feel forced to have sex with me, but now with all these new issues, I feel like any and every time I had sex would be like that‚Ä¶and I just cant handle it. I feel like I never will be able to have sex again, because I will never believe that the other person truly wants me too. I always will believe that I‚Äôm the only one who really enjoys it, and the other one just tries to do it like a ‚Äújob‚Äù, with or without success. I cant even masturbate right now, because when I try to think of something, at some point my inner voice goes like ‚Äúwait, this is ridiculous, there is no way they would want to do that with you‚Äù

Magic is a game of resources and if you can do things without spending resources you are already ahead of the person who did. Apart from being simply more efficient, free spells open up way more lines of play, how many cards worry about what and how many spells you cast, how many cards care about a card entering or leaving play, how many cards care about what and how many you have in play, it‚Äôs all significantly easier to accomplish if you aren‚Äôt spending resources to do these things.

But just because there are now more patients (from out-of-state) does not mean clinics aren't having financial problems, particularly independent clinics that are not Planned Parenthood.

There's a particular clinic in Minnesota that is in dire straits. In the interest of not putting them on blast in a public forum, I'm not going to mention their name here or link to their fundraising campaign. But if you're interested in donating to help keep them afloat and to keep providing essential reproductive healthcare access, **please message me** and I'll give you the details. (EDIT: FYI full disclosure, I will check your profile before giving out the link.)

And honestly: just donate to whatever fave clinic you may have! It's vitally important to protect this access.

Source: I am a clinic escort for two abortion clinics in the state. Clinic escorts help usher patients safely into the building and shield them from the anti-choice protestors just feet outside the property who like to yell, condemn, hold signs, and generally confuse and upset people. (Last week I was called a ""miserable slut"" who hates women. (I'm female.)) We are not paid, we are not there to counsel or argue; we are there to help people safely access the health care they need - whether that's an abortion, a pelvic exam, or a flu shot. It's a service I deeply value.

**AITA for blocking my childhood best friend after she tried to make me pay for the catering at her son's first birthday?**

&amp;#x200B;

So here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîme (28F) and Anna (28F) have been best friends since forever. Like, we grew up together, went through school, first breakups, everything. Naturally, when she had her baby, I was thrilled for her. I even helped plan the baby shower and got super involved in her life as a new mom. But recently, things have gotten weird.

Anna‚Äôs son turned one last weekend, and she wanted to throw a huge party. I'm talking over-the-top: rented venue, professional catering, decorations, the whole shebang. Now, I thought we were just going to have a nice little family-and-friends thing, but nope, Anna had a vision. Fine, no biggie. I figured she could do whatever made her happy for her son‚Äôs big day.

Fast forward to a week before the party. Anna starts hinting that she‚Äôs ‚Äúa little stressed‚Äù about costs and how ‚Äútight things are right now.‚Äù I get it, having a baby is expensive, but she kept bringing it up in every conversation. I offered to help with decorations or pick up some snacks, but she waved it off, saying she had everything under control.

The day of the party comes, and it‚Äôs chaos, balloons everywhere, a bouncy house, tons of people I didn‚Äôt even know. I show up early to help set up, and Anna‚Äôs running around like a headless chicken. Then, as we‚Äôre putting out the decorations, she casually says, ‚ÄúOh, by the way, I put the catering on your card.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt even seen a catering bill, let alone agreed to pay for one. ‚ÄúUh, what do you mean you put it on my card?‚Äù I asked, trying to stay calm.

She looked at me like I was being dramatic and goes, ‚ÄúYeah, you know I‚Äôve been struggling. I figured you wouldn‚Äôt mind covering it, and I‚Äôll pay you back later.‚Äù Excuse me?!

First of all, I never once said she could use my card, and second, I had no clue how much this catering even cost. When I asked, she shrugged and said, ‚ÄúOnly about $500. It‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù $500! For food I didn‚Äôt even order or agree to pay for.

I told her no way. I wasn‚Äôt paying for something she never asked permission for, and frankly, I didn‚Äôt have that kind of money just lying around. She acted all shocked and hurt, saying I was being selfish and how it was her son‚Äôs first birthday. As if I‚Äôm supposed to go into debt for a party I didn‚Äôt even throw!

We had a massive argument in front of some of her other friends, and I ended up leaving early. Later that night, she blew up my phone with texts saying I ruined her son‚Äôs day, that I was being a terrible friend, and how I didn‚Äôt understand how hard things are for her right now.

I just couldn‚Äôt believe the audacity. After everything, I blocked her. I couldn‚Äôt deal with the guilt-tripping, especially over something so ridiculous.

Now, some mutual friends have reached out, saying I was too harsh and that I should‚Äôve just helped her out because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs struggling.‚Äù But I feel like she crossed a line. You don‚Äôt just throw someone‚Äôs money into your plans without asking them, right?

So, AITA for blocking her? Or did I overreact?

EDIT:

To everyone asking why she has access to my card is still a question to me. Maybe she went through my things when I visited her to help babysit her son a day before his birthday. On how she did it? I don't know, but I already filed a dispute with my bank about the charge. I will be checking my card to see if there are any other things she purchased using my card. I really can't imagine that she could do this to me.

*NTA That's fraud... Also if one is ""struggling"" one doesn't spend $500 on a one year old's birthday party. Your former friend is ridiculous.*

&amp;#x200B;

**NocentBystander**

*$500 or more is Grand Theft. Which is a felony (in some jurisdictions, you can all stop correcting me now).*

&amp;#x200B;

**ThrowAway-420-2021**

*NTA. The audacity of some people‚Ä¶ quick question: Why would your friend have your card to begin with? That struck me as odd‚Ä¶*

&gt;OOP: That is the question I was asking myself as well. I was so caught up in the moment that it didn't hit me on how she had access to my card number.

I never expected this to blow up‚Äîthank you all for your advice. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company. I also told her parents about the incident, and they were shocked by her behavior. They said they would talk to her. I figured they already did because after I told them what happened, she stormed over to my house, ranting about why I was making such a big deal by telling her parents and reminding me that we‚Äôve been best friends who literally grew up together.

I explained where she went wrong, but instead of taking accountability, she accused me of being selfish. She clearly isn‚Äôt in the right mind. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs experiencing postpartum issues, but I‚Äôm not going to tolerate this kind of treatment. I also told her that if she didn‚Äôt stop harassing me over a problem she created, I will file a restraining order.

As for the money she used, I‚Äôve decided to follow your advice and press charges, so she can (hopefully) learn her lesson. For those doubting if this story is real, I wish it wasn‚Äôt. Not only was my trust shattered, but so was my heart.

*Your ex-friend sounds entitled af. You may want to seriously consider canceling the card she used and getting a new one issued. I know it's a pain but you never know if she'll use it again to be petty. You're still NTA but it sounds like you could use some better friends.*

&amp;#x200B;

**BootyNicolas**

*I totally agree. I'm positive that if she has a chance again she'll still use OP's card.*

*I'll advice she gets a new card instead.*

&amp;#x200B;

**PrideofCapetown**

*I vote for a new card too.*

*And just in case any mutual friends try and give OP grief for not letting the thief get away with her crime, OP should tell them to put their money where their mouth is and contribute their own cash.*

4602,UPDATE: AITHA for losing empathy for my traumatized husband?,"UPDATE

TW: Mentions of abuse

Hi all! Thank you so much for the kind words and support, it has gotten me through this tough time.

I am happy to say the divorce is now finalized! 

Here is an update on how the past 3 months have been:)  

When I went back to the house  a few months ago to get my cats (had to leave the dogs sadly) and he was there! He tried saying in 6 months after therapy things would change and I‚Äôm abandoning my family and responsibilities. He proceeded to say I was selfish and was leaving for another man, after I kept tell him no. Finally, after he knew I was standing my ground, he said he would leave. He looked me in the eyes and his pupils had turned black (something I had seen a few times beforeüòÖ) and creepily said ‚Äúgoodbye ‚Äòmy name‚Äô‚Äù I then called my mom crying and scared and he came back in the house and kept saying the same things. He finally left. He kept trying to contact me and my dad a lot the week after.

He is of course telling everyone how awful I am and that I‚Äôm a cheater and abandoned him and his kid.

Oh well‚Ä¶ I also forgot to mention once he pushed me up against the bathroom vanity by my neck and then choke slammed me after I attack him back. I always blamed myself because there was alcohol involved and he tried telling me the next morning he acted in self defense because I ‚Äúattacked him first‚Äù he even took pictures of his scratches in case I called the cops‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt take pictures of my bruises

There were also three times throughout the years that he would restrain both of my wrists and not let me move if I tried to get some space during an argument. I never knew or considered this abuse and know how much worse it could have been. 

He recently texted me saying he saw my profile picture and accused me of being with another man days after leaving him...he said I was in another man's pickup truck, but it was literally his truck and a picture I had taken after getting my hair done for wedding pics...I sent him that same photo 2 years ago when I had taken it. 

Thank you all, I am doing very well. I still struggle with guilt and trusting my reality on some days, but it‚Äôs better.

4621,I love how HOTD made visually different breeds of dragons,"That there's basically two types of dragons: war dragons and breeder dragons and you can visually tell which is which. 

Like take Vermithor, Meleys, Seasmoke and Vhagar:  they are massive, bulky, with a lot of spikes and horns (although Vhagar's most likely fell out due to age) and overall they have a more aggressive face and a more fiery temper. And it makes sense - you'd want a war dragon to be massive and ferocious, to be more durable and aggressive, while also having those spikes to protect it from other dragon's attacks (makes me wonder if those war dragons were actually bred for some gladiator like battles in Old Valyria, kinda makes sense). 

But then take Silverwing and Syrax: they are more elegant, slimmer, they don't have those sharp spikes and they have a calmer temper. 

But there's also Caraxes who appears to be a mix of both: he is slender and not at all bulky, but he has a nasty aggressive character and some sharp spikes on him. 

I just love those design choices, it really brings out how dragons aren't just CGI in HOTD, they are supposed to be perceived as alive and real. But it makes me wonder if they have a dragon chihuahua there somewhere. ",/r/HouseOfTheDragon/comments/1fr8n6g/i_love_how_hotd_made_visually_different_breeds_of/

4624,A stranger walked up to me and said I look really sad and that I shouldn't worry because things will get better then gave me a hug.,"As surprised as I was by her randomness, I was more surprised by my own reaction. I just couldn't help but sob into her arms when she hugged me. She just rubbed my back and told me that everything is going to be okay. I felt awkward afterwards and apologized for breaking down but she reassured me that it's okay. I thanked her and then after she made sure that I was alright, she went on her way.

I almost got emotional again just thinking of her kindness. I have been dealing with a lot and I didn't realize that I look exactly like that. From dealing with the death of my mom to homelessness, sleeping in public toilets crying myself to sleep, it's all been too much. Her actions blew me away, she really made me feel like I matter. Something I hadn't felt like in a really long time and I will never forget that. A little kindness always goes a long way.

We never talked much about the style or cut I wanted, he remembers me showing him some green rings and emerald is one of my favorite stones.

4644, AITA for not wanting to go to my brother‚Äôs wedding because my SIL keeps making jokes about my past addiction?,"So I (34F) have a bit of a situation going on with my brother (30M) and his fiance Amara (29F). To give some context, I‚Äôve been sober for about 4 years now, but in my early twenties, I struggled with alcohol and drugs. It was a really dark time for me, and I worked *hard* to get to where I am now. My brother has always been super supportive, but Amara... not so much.

At first, it was little things that I tried to ignore. At family dinners, she'd say things like ‚Äúoh better keep the wine bottle away from \[my name\]!‚Äù and laugh like it was funny. I didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it, so I just kind of awkwardly smiled and moved on. But then it started happening more and more.

A couple of months ago, we were all out at a restaurant with friends, and Amara made a joke about how ""if we run out of booze at the wedding, we‚Äôll know who drank it all."" It was *so* embarrassing. Everyone kind of laughed, but it was that awkward, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say‚Äù kind of laugh. I felt sick.

I ended up talking to her after that, trying to explain how much those comments hurt, and she just rolled her eyes and said I was being too sensitive, that it was just a joke. But it doesn‚Äôt feel like a joke to me. My sobriety is such a huge part of my life and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm ashamed of, but when she makes those comments, I feel like all the hard work I‚Äôve done just gets reduced to being the ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù in the room.

The worst part was last week. We were talking about wedding plans and she made another comment, something like, ‚ÄúAre you sure you can handle the open bar? Or should we get a babysitter for you?‚Äù I just... I couldn‚Äôt take it. My brother was there and didn‚Äôt say *anything.* I left because I was so mad, but also hurt that my own brother wouldn‚Äôt defend me.

I tried to talk to him about it afterward, and while he admits that Amara's jokes are out of line, he keeps saying it‚Äôs ""just her sense of humor"" and that I need to let it go. He says she doesn‚Äôt mean it ""in a bad way"" and that I‚Äôm overreacting.

But I don‚Äôt think I am. I‚Äôm at the point where I really don‚Äôt want to go to their wedding. I know it‚Äôs his big day and all, but I can‚Äôt imagine being there, sitting at a table, knowing Amara‚Äôs going to make more comments, and feeling like I‚Äôm the joke. When I told my brother this, he got super upset, saying I was going to ruin the wedding and that family comes first.

So, now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love my brother. I don‚Äôt think I should have to suck it up and be miserable just to keep the peace.

As you can see the Celtics are by far #1, with an average distance of 11'4. And the Knicks are **dead last** at 7'8.


The Knicks are replacing complete non shooters like Mitchell Robinson/Isaiah Hartenstein for the best shooting center of all time. Jalen Brunson is about to feast in the paint. When Brunson was in Dallas he was statisitically one of the best guard finishers in the entire league (he shot 75% inside of 3 feet his final 2 seasons there).

4841,Nobody has aged in 72 years. The men in gas masks are telling us they‚Äôre here to help.,"On December 27th 2024 -- 7:51 AM to be precise-- nothing aged anymore. We knew the exact moment this happened because the very concept of aging became alien to us.



I remember thinking one day about my eighteenth birthday, when the idea of getting older instantly felt like quantum physics.



You would think the death of aging would be a good thing. Now, there were no more obstacles to living forever.



We COULD live forever, but we were stuck in our unchanging bodies.



I‚Äôm 80 years old, yet I still look like I‚Äôm 18. My grandpa just turned 160.



Even worse were those born after aging died. They would remain infants forever.



We called these eternal babies the Natals. I have a younger brother who's a Natal. His name is Liam.¬†



On March 12 2096, --10:38 PM to be precise-- the skies parted and the angels descended.



They weren't winged people, not even rings of eyes. Just men in vintage gas masks, wearing clothes you would see from a passenger on the Titanic.



One of the angels knocked on my door. He promised to explain everything, so I let him in.



‚ÄúYou might want to sit down, this will take a hot minute.‚Äù



He explained that gods exist, but not like we think. What we call ‚Äògods‚Äô are just the embodiments of concepts. There's a god for near everything, from something great as the sun to something as minor as DVDs of Home Alone.



‚ÄúThe one who was what you called ‚ÄòAging‚Äô... It's dead.‚Äù



Apparently, the god that made the gasmask-angels was angry at Aging for insulting how modern it was. Its embodiment was conceived only in the 20th century! The god furiously attacked Aging and‚Ä¶ killed it.



‚ÄúIt's just not possible.‚Äù The angel explained.



‚ÄúGods can't kill each other. It's impossible. A god of nukes can't even scratch a god of cardstock. How did it even happen?‚Äù



He explained that the other gods are monitoring the murdering god, and making it clean up its mess on earth.¬†



*‚ÄúWhy didn't you start sooner?‚Äù*



‚ÄúIt took a lot of time to create us angels. That's the only way our god can make contact.‚Äù



*‚ÄúAnd how will you start?‚Äù*



‚ÄúFirst we‚Äôll deal with the Natals.‚Äù



I heard choking from Liam‚Äôs room.¬†



The angel gripped my hand. It was impossibly tight.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry. We don't want it to be this painful. But we have the element of our god. We need to use it. It's too efficient! It's too efficient and we know it hurts but it's our orders!‚Äù



In the tinted lenses of the mask, I could see near infinite remorse.



*‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ What are you the angels of? What is your god the god of?!‚Äù*



He sighed.



‚ÄúYou look like you know SOME history about the earth.‚Äù



The ragged gasping from Liam's room faded.



‚ÄúDo you know what mustard gas is?‚Äù

4849,"AIO My whole family my parents, two sisters, their husbands and there kids planned a vacation without my family!  ","My husband and 4 kids (14,11,7,4) just got back from vacation with my in-laws. It was a great time for the kids and as a reference I talked to one of my sisters and my mom while we were gone so I was reachable. Well yesterday my mom called me and tells me while I was gone my parents, my sisters, their spouses and their kids (1,9) all booked a cruise together for next summer. We had been taking about going on a family vacation over spring break or during summer next year. I had told them due to my family having 6 people it would need to be 12-13 hours drive so we didn‚Äôt spend $2,000 or more just on airfare. I had told them they can fly and we would meet them it wouldn‚Äôt bother us. I suggested many places. 

Well after my mom told me they booked the trip and that she thought it would be too expensive for my whole family to go but could she take my 11 year old with them. Mind you I have 4 kids so not only did you wait for me to go out of town to book and plan a trip my family is not invited to. You all then know what my financial situation is? On top of all that she thinks I‚Äôm going to just let her take my 11 year old out of the country on some cruise that O yeah did I mention kids 12 and under are free. So 3 of my kids would have been free for them to be on the cruise. 

I am hurt, I am angry and I as you might have been able to tell this is not the first time me or my family has been left out of plans with my side of the family. I know I‚Äôm the black sheep but this doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less or will make it hurt my children any less when they find out that they are being excluded. I have been low contact with my oldest sister but with them doing this I‚Äôm thinking it will need to be everyone my younger children still love to see them so I‚Äôve stayed in contact for them.  

Edit to add 
Ok so I think people miss understood. My sisters and I have been planning to take my parents on a trip we originally talked about a beach vacation. When we said beach vacation I said ok can we do something 12-13 hours way I‚Äôll drive to save some money you guys can fly. They said yeah sounds goods. We have the money for 6 flights but I could also use that for another trip or sending several of my kids to special camps.  I know 4 kids is a lot it‚Äôs not for everyone that‚Äôs ok. My kids are great, respectful and kind. They have there moments like ALL KIDS. 

I I‚Äôm hurt and upset because they did this all behind my back. When I talked to my mom on the phone she said we didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal then said o and by the way 12 and under is free can I take (blank) my 11 year old. Thats when I got really upset. More so for my kids than for myself. I don‚Äôt need my kids to see the favoritism that I have been sheltering them from for years.

*** Article slides included in post 

Some really bad PR for Hank's beloved Ingriftus Games. 

Some snippets:

&gt; With the next Invictus Games coming to Vancouver this winter, [Scott] Snow is sounding the alarm about the lack of care for retired veterans by Canadian organizers. Prince Harry's initiative, at least at the Canadian end, is leaving them to fend for themselves as soon as the cameras are switched off, he
says.

&gt; Snow says he was thankful for the experience of being at the Invictus Games and socializing with other military personnel. He says the organizers ""did a great job"" accommodating them and their families. He talks about Prince Harry being good man, a great soldier.' But that seems to be the extent of it, and it bothers him.

&gt; The Star spoke to three other veterans who have competed at the Invictus Games and have faced a similar predicament, or know colleagues who have. They didn't want their names or personal stories shared publicly for fear of potential repercussions from the military.

&gt; Like Snow, they say Veteran Affairs Canada has always treated them well, but add that it's unfair for organizers of the Invictus Games team to have what they call a two-tier health coverage. They say other countries treat all
participants the same way.

&gt; Medical support is available to both active and veteran members during training camps and over the course of the Games, but it does not go beyond that and does not include any hospitalization costs, [Canadian Department of National Defence spokesperson Kened Sadiku] says. Participants are ""free to withdraw"" at any time as it's a voluntary activity, he adds.

&gt; Snow says the distinction isn't made clear enough... ""They give you the impression that they've got your back, and you think you're back in the game again,"" he says. ""But you're not.""

&gt; Sadiku says there is room to improve. ""We are working to address a potential gap in coverage for veteran participants that do not have their own additional medical insurance that covers after-Games treatment,'' he says. ""Currently,
Soldier On is working with our partners and health insurance providers to determine what additional coverage could be implemented to ensure that there are no gaps for the participants after the event.""

Early showings of this game were lacklustre but it feels clear now that the game is on the right track. 

As long as it isn‚Äôt a total bomb, it‚Äôs also up to us to show that gamers care about this franchise. 

It‚Äôs out in less than two weeks (Oct 8) and it couldn‚Äôt be released at a better time of year.

&gt;
&gt;For over a century, scientists have hypothesized that a cell like this existed ‚Äì and now, an adult version has been found at last, hiding in the aorta of grown mice.
&gt;
&gt;The discovery was nine years in the making. Researchers have named the cells 'EndoMac progenitors', and the team is now searching for similar players in the human body.
&gt;
&gt;""These cells have an important job, to help grow blood vessels when the body calls for it,"" explains medical scientist Sanuri Liyanage from the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI).
&gt;
&gt;""They are activated by injury or poor blood flow, at which point they rapidly expand to aid in healing.""
&gt;
&gt;Liyanage and colleagues isolated EndoMac progenitor cells from mice and cultured them in the lab, where they formed colonies. When injected into diabetic mouse models, the cell colonies dramatically improved wound healing.

They climb the stairs from the front door into the kitchen and dining room, which open into the living room. Dad grabs a few beers, and he and Tom head to the table. Meanwhile, Susan is giving herself an in-depth tour, wandering through the rooms, looking at everything, touching everything.

As if that weren't WTF enough in the home of someone the first time, Susan suddenly declares, ""Bill! This place is a MESS!""

My poor dad was literally rendered speechless.

For starters, it was a blatant lie. Dad is in his late 60s but in excellent physical health and totally keeps things neat and clean. (Of course, there's always a little clutter or whatnot, but it's the typical things like a stack of mail that hasn't been gone through yet, some snacks, just little things you expect in any home that has people living in it.) But for another, this woman was a guest in his home. Had he been a hoarder worthy of his own Netflix episode, it would have been proper manners to keep her mouth shut.

But as Dad floundered, the plot thickened.

""But don't worry, Bill!"" Susan continued cheerfully. ""I'll come and clean for you! I've been looking for a new housecleaning customer, so I have plenty of time to come work here! My rates are just X dollars - you're so lucky I came by to help you out! I'll start tomorrow!""

Apparently my father is a much more restrained person than I am - I don't believe I could have handled it as calmly as he did, under the circumstances. He just gave her a firm no thank you, I don't need any help at this time. (Of course, Susan didn't just accept that. He had to tell her several times before she finally backed down.)

[I hate my daughter](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fgtns7/i_hate_my_daughter/) - September 14, 2024

I know this will make me seem bad and all, but above all I really just need a place to vent. I can't talk about it with my friends or family nor do I really want to.

I'm 27 and I've had a fwb situation with a guy I went to college with. Let's call him Mark. We were both young and not ready for a relationship. Then I got pregnant. I told Mark about it since I wanted to discuss our options. Abortion, adoption or even giving him custody if he wanted to. I never wanted kids, so I'd be fine with any compromise.

However, Mark didn't take it well. I remember him insisting we could make it work, especially since we were both in our last year old college. He wanted to get married and for us to be a family. I refused. He got his family involved. They called and texted me all the time, even showing up at my part-time job.

I know I have no one to blame but myself, but I gave up. I had too many things going on at that time like the loss of my mother, the stress with the rest of the family and some stuff going on with my best friend that I won't get into. I remember feeling horrible, but I relented and agreed to keep the baby although I still refused to get married to Mark.

Now we have a 5 year old daughter together. I'm a mess. I never wanted kids and although I'm trying, I can't feel any motherly love for her. What makes it worse is that she's genuinely a good kid. She doesn't throw much tantrums, she's always kind and she doesn't expect much.

I feel guilty for hating her. I feel bad all the time. I only get to have her on the weekends and Mark has her every other day, but that doesn't make me feel better. She talks about wanting to see me and her dad together, but I just can't. I screamed at her once when she drew a little picture of me and Mark holding hands. I apologized after, but I still felt so guilty.

I don't know what I'm doing. I just needed to write everything down and get it off my chest. I know I'm a bad mother, I know it. But I don't know how to be better. I don't even know if I want to be better. I just want to give up my parental rights, but even the thought makes me feel even worse. I'm stuck in a hell of my own making, I know I should've fought harder and probably just abort her. Damn me for being weak, I guess.

[Update - I hate my daughter](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fm9nrn/update_i_hate_my_daughter/) - September 21, 2024

Some things have happened and I need to write them down, maybe even get some insight.

I'll call my daughter Abby for the sake of this post.

I ended up telling Mark about my desire to change the custody arrangement and maybe even removing my parental rights. Many people here agreed that it's the best choice, both for me and for Abby.

He didn't take it well and actually texted me about it through the week. He insisted we could work out whatever was bothering me.

We agreed a while ago that texting is okay, but calls are for emergencies only. So when he called me on Friday evening and pleaded with me to come see Abby, I agreed.

This is what I really need to talk about. I've seen Abby cry before, but this was something else. She had a complete meltdown, screaming and crying once I got there. She just clung to my leg and screamed at me not to leave her, why did I want to leave her, what did she do wrong.

I cried. I was honestly horrified with how badly she reacted. Mark's mom ended up telling Abby that I was planning on leaving her and she's not going to go to my house this weekend.

I had to take Abby to my place sooner than expected and Mark actually spent the night over as well. He said he's too concerned with Abby and with me to leave us alone.

I'm completely lost. Even with the way I said that I want to give up my parental rights, I just can't do it now. The image of Abby crying and pleading with me not to leave is just stuck in my mind. I feel hopeless about the entire situation.

Currently, I'm laying with Abby on the couch and she's watching TV. She hasn't really left my side since yesterday. I'm used to her pointing at the TV while talking about her favorite characters of whatever cartoon is on. Right now, she's just laying by my side and staying quiet. I can hear Mark moving around in the kitchen. He called in sick to work and said he's staying here for the weekend. I have no idea what to do. And I'm sorry, but I no longer want to leave Abby, that's not an option anymore.

Edit: I'd just like to edit and ask for some suggestions about online therapy? What sites do I look for that I'm sure will help me and don't cost too much? Mark is already looking into therapists for Abby in the area, but I'd like to ask for some individual therapy I could attend online. Maybe even suggestions for child therapists online in case Mark doesn't find anyone.

4977, AIW for Causing a Scene on an Airplane After Someone Stole My Snack?,"**I (F28) recently took a flight for a short vacation, and I was looking forward to enjoying my favorite travel snack: a pack of gourmet chocolate-covered almonds. I always bring them on flights as a little treat for myself, and I was excited to dig in after the plane took off.**

**Once we were in the air, I pulled out my snack and placed it in the seat pocket for a moment while I got comfortable. That‚Äôs when the guy sitting next to me, let‚Äôs call him Mark (30s), suddenly reached over and grabbed my snack pack without asking! I thought he was joking at first, but he opened it and started munching away.**

**I was shocked and honestly pretty angry. I asked him, ‚ÄúHey, those are mine!‚Äù He looked at me like I was overreacting and said, ‚ÄúRelax, I thought you weren‚Äôt going to eat them.‚Äù I told him that it didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîhe had no right to take my food.**

**At this point, I was really annoyed. I raised my voice a bit, asking the flight attendant for help. She came over, and I explained what happened. Mark started laughing and said I was being dramatic. The flight attendant ended up taking my snack back from him and gave me a replacement snack from the airline.**

**While I was grateful, I felt like I had caused a scene. Some passengers around me were snickering, and a few even told me I was right to stand up for myself. But others seemed annoyed that I made such a fuss over a snack.**

**Now I‚Äôm left wondering if I overreacted. It was just a snack, but I felt disrespected.**

Hey gents, wanted to circulate these resource for the former military folks. President Biden, in June, issued full pardons for folks discharged under Article 125 of the UCMJ (sodomy)--BUT you have to apply for the certificate to prove the pardon.  And messy as government recordkeeping can be, you may be better served going to them proactively.

More here: [https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Presidential-Pardon-Resources/](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Presidential-Pardon-Resources/)

For other non-military applications closely related, you can check this out: [http://justice.gov/pardon/apply-pardon](http://justice.gov/pardon/apply-pardon)

And finally, if you are pardoned you may be able to seek more benefits from the VA: [https://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp](https://www.va.gov/ogc/accreditation.asp)

5065,To the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited for Oaks because he‚Äôs worse‚Äù people:,"I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I also really want people to leave this godawful corporate religion and watch it crumble away.

But things will get notably worse under Oaks, especially for LGBTQ+ people. Yes, his bigotry will cause people to question things and leave, but it will also cause a non-zero number of people to double down and become more cruel, more hateful.

Plus, the church has a HUGE chokehold on Utah‚Äôs politics. Laws have already been passed that make trans people‚Äôs lives in particular a living nightmare, and there will be worse ones that target more members of the queer community, and more directly. The recent church handbook changes are just the beginning, and we all know that the church‚Äôs policies affect Utah‚Äôs culture.

What I wanna get at is this: people will die under Oaks. The man already has blood on his hands from his electroshock therapy era at BYU, but it will get so, so much worse. There are still so many LGBTQ+ members who, for one reason or another, can‚Äôt leave. Maybe they‚Äôre closeted, maybe they‚Äôre stuck with family. Many simply have nowhere else to go, nor the means to do so.

So please, if you have the privilege of not being directly affected by Oaks‚Äôs inevitable bullshit, can we ask you to please use whatever means you have to help soften the blow for those that will? Reach out to local communities, volunteer,  donate to organizations that can help queer people escape abusive situations. Even just openly speaking out against things will help people know they‚Äôre not alone.

Show people that there is greater hope, love, and acceptance away from the church.",/r/exmormon/comments/1frmv4j/to_the_im_excited_for_oaks_because_hes_worse/

5116,"Stop eating when the cook says so, or he might just feed you raw chicken. ","This happened yesterday. I‚Äôm the younger sibling in the family, and we had a small get-together at home. I took up the role of barbecuing chicken for everyone, which I really enjoy. My older sister, who's married, was also there. 

While I was barbecuing, I noticed the plate wasn‚Äôt filling up because she kept swooping in and eating the chicken before I could even get it to the table. I was mildly annoyed. I asked her to stop because there wasn‚Äôt much chicken, and everyone needed to eat. But it was like I was talking to a wall. She brushed me off and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm helping by tasting the food,‚Äù as if that justified it.

So, cue a little petty revenge. I decided to make the next batch of chicken look perfect on the outside but left it raw on the inside. My sister, like clockwork, swooped in again and took a bite without checking. The second she did, she knew it was raw, and immediately spat it out and rushed off to wash her mouth.

Everyone else at the get-together was laughing, but my sister? She didn‚Äôt eat any more chicken for the rest of the night.

5130,My boyfriend stopped going down on because he watched a movie that said it‚Äôs gay. What should I do?,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for more than a year. Going down on each other has never really been a problem in our relationship the first few months. It started when the relationship became toxic and he implemented a one sided open rs that only benefits him. Its over now and we‚Äôre both healthy but the sex just feels meh for me since foreplay is my favorite part and I just really love receiving. I asked him a couple of times about it and he just kept saying that he thinks it‚Äôs gay because he saw a movie that said it was and it completely changed his mind. It broke me. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs been a year since I last received head from him and I only asked twice or three times because it felt so embarrassing to even have to ask. Sometimes I‚Äôd ask questions if it tastes bad and he specifically told me that it‚Äôs sweet and he never tasted any pussy this delicious. I give him head multiple times a day and would do anything he asks me even though I‚Äôm not in the mood and I really just don‚Äôt like doing it. But I know it makes him happy and I‚Äôm always trying to be a good partner. Even when we‚Äôd 69 he wouldn‚Äôt eat me out, he‚Äôd just finger me and he knows I don‚Äôt like it. The sex doesn‚Äôt satisfy me anymore and I stopped getting wet. What should I do? I hope this isn‚Äôt a stupid question but I just don‚Äôt know anymore.

Edit: I am a female and I truly hope I am just kidding . Thank you for everyone that told me what to do :) I‚Äôll talk to him and also ask what movie it was for those who were curious. I‚Äôll update again soon!",/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1fram3x/my_boyfriend_stopped_going_down_on_because_he/

This weekend, my girlfriend and I went to Atlanta. We got an Airbnb, went to the aquarium, and had a good time .

I told her, ""This is why I have money and you don‚Äôt,"" which was kind of mean but true because she tends to spend it all. 

To be fair, I‚Äôve already spent about $600-$700 on food and gifts for her, and we‚Äôve only been dating for four months. This Atlanta trip alone has cost me $500, and she contributed $300, which I appreciate.

5207,"You want to vicariously set off an overstimulated hospitality worker‚Äôs sensory disorder? Time for us both to be uncomfortable, Kevin. ","
I worked at a coffee shop when I was a teenager, and was eating sushi on my break upon a bench that faced the front of Coles (for those of you who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a big grocery shop). Also important to the story, I have level 2 Autism and find loud, sudden and aggressive noises very disconcerting. I had worked a variety of retail and hospitality jobs that made me develop a tough spine for customer interactions and confrontation when necessary. I had just realised I had forgotten my earphones at home when a Kevin (male term for a Karen) from Coles‚Äô ‚Äú12 items or less aisle‚Äù was on a rant, berating the poor checkout lady that the ‚Äúcustomer is always right‚Äù and that she should hurry up and scan his groceries‚Ä¶that are very clearly overflowing from his trolley. 

This went on for a long time and I had enough of this asshole triggering my sensory issues. Time for us both to be uncomfortable, I decided. I grabbed a T shirt from my bag that I had planned to wear after work, put it on to cover my uniform and confronted the man-child as he was just finishing re peating that the ‚Äúcustomer is always right‚Äù. I looked at him, then exaggeratedly at his trolley, saying ‚ÄúWow, really? That must be some trick you have, there.‚Äù He snapped that it was none of my business but that if I must know, he was a customer and therefore correct. I promptly leaned over to the checkout lady, asking her for a chocolate bar from the display at the checkout. She was confused, but gave it to me nonetheless. I then explained to ‚ÄòKevin‚Äô (I‚Äôll just call him that), that now I‚Äôm a customer too and therefore right, and that he very clearly had more than 12 items. ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù I said smugly. Clearly defeated at his own game, Kevin stammered, embarrassed and enraged. ‚ÄúWant me to help you count?‚Äù I pressed sweetly. I took his hand like a preschool teacher, extended his pointer finger and made him count his own groceries until he got so embarrassed that he left to the self checkout aisle, tail between his legs and pissed off. The entire line erupted into laughter and even let me go first to buy my chocolate, which I gave to the checkout lady. The next customer in the line congratulated me, still smiling. I took off my outer shirt, revealing my work uniform, taking a dramatic bow and announcing ‚Äúthank you, I‚Äôll be here all week at that coffee shop over there, ladies and gentlemen‚Äù like a comedian. I got some more laughs and I thought that would be the end of it. I went back to work a short time later, very pleased with myself only to find a lineup at my coffee shop full of people telling my boss that I deserve a raise üòÇ I joked to him that I should get paid for advertising and we had a good laugh.",/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1frfcfa/you_want_to_vicariously_set_off_an_overstimulated/

She let the oscar rescue squad‚Ñ¢ run because where are they going to run to the grimm army outside?

She had plenty of time to beat up hazel for his betrayal because no one was a threat to her and they had nowhere to run so she could have some fun

But then she looks up at oscar who hadn't ran for some reason probably thinking ""oh my ozma tiny vessel thinks he can do something despite me swatting him away earlier"" but then she looks more and sees the cane glowing 

And despite knowing oscar is scared and beat to hell

Despite knowing ozma was not who he used to be and doesn't have the magic to threaten her anymore and even if he did it would be a minor hurdle with her Immortality 

Despite knowing oscar and oz were probably the smallest threat around at the moment 

She immediately changes targets because she knew immediately oz has something in his pocket 

I think salem as much as she boasts about how its futile to resist her she is genuinely aware ozma is a threat to her and even when she believes she won he can turn it around

I will tell you what he said on messenger to me about 3 days ago:

Him: right now.do you want to hear the truth?
Me: yes
Him: I wanted to feel loved and I wanted it to be with you after going years with nobody. You were the first one I made that decision with in so many years and it was because you were so beautiful to me. I thought we would BOTH feel loved but yeah I really wanted to feel close to you like that and just love each other. I don't have sex with anyone. You can talk to anyone who knows me I never was like that.




He basically denied raping me so many times even tho he did I told him no and he raped me...in the woods strangling me and covering my mouth while I was screaming so nobody could hear me that was passing by. He was so brutal with me....and now he's basically saying he chose to do what he did to me because I was so beautiful to him. Basically. You know I won't get that confession that he did what he did from him. I feel so sick I always held onto my beauty as a safety net and now I feel so sick beyond words as if it was my fault for being beautiful he raped me 
...I feel like self harming but I dont want to I feel so overwhelmed and evertime I look in the mirror and try to do my daily affirmations about myself I think of him. What do I do...please some compassion would be needed....I feel so sick....I at least thoufht when he raped me he never broifht up about.my looks but now my worst fear has come. My heart feels destroyed. As if it couldn't get worse.......I feel useless. Like my life is over. Because I don't even like myself or my face now since he did what he did because I was beautiful. ..I called a rape crisis hotline and they didn't say anything about how I felt. I told them the exact same stuff it feels like nobody understands me and wants to see me fail....all the woman told me was to try to get a therapist. I told her my insurance doesn't cover therapy

**AITAH for tricking my ex into admitting to her affair**

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much title. I felt like something was off so I went through her phone and found messages between her and a male ""friend"" that seemed suspect (discussing meeting up when she'd never mentioned it to me, flirting, talking in coded language about sex, etc). There was nothing overt, but still pretty sketchy.

I figured she'd just lie and bury things deeper if I confronted her (and she was actually cheating), so I set up a fake instagram account and sent her a message saying I knew she was fucking her friend, had the receipts, and was going to contact her partner in three days whether or not she confessed.

The next day she sat me down and admitted to cheating, but wouldn't tell me who it was or how long it'd been going on. She was sorry, she loved me and wanted to make things work, it meant nothing, blah blah blah

I told her that I already knew, and that it was me who had sent her the message. My ex lost it and I had to leave the apartment and go stay with a friend to get away from her. She was gone along with most of her clothes when I came back the next day. She'd completely trashed the place while I was gone.

This all happened a few weeks ago and it has been pretty tough ever since. It's sucked having to find a new place to live and separating our stuff while dealing with feeling like shit. To make it worse I'd met the guy several times, shaken his hand, bought him a drink, thought he was harmless, etc. Mostly I feel like an idiot for having trusted her... I've never cheated on anyone and I assumed my ex was cut out of the same cloth.

My ex is adamant that I'm an asshole for what I did to her, but I don't really feel like I owe her anything.

I dunno, am I the asshole here?

&gt;My ex is adamant that I'm an asshole for what I did to her, but I don't really feel like I owe her anything.

*For what you did to her? Wow, she's desperately trying to find an offensive position when in reality she's victim blaming.*

*I applaud you for what you did, which was to catch her cheating and call her out. Guess the other dude can continue making his ""deposits"" because she's morally bankrupt. You should send him a celebratory bottle of wine as a gift for getting her out of your life.*

*Does the other guy know she's a cheater? If not, there's a future* r/pettyrevenge *story here.*

*NTA*

&gt;OOP: Yeah, he knew about me, we'd met on several occasions and he'd been introduced to me as a friend. He's just as gross and morally bankrupt as her, they deserve each other. I don't really feel like I need or want any revenge. I just want her out of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

*NTA. The only asshole here is her for cheating on you. She's just mad you outsmarted her.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Update - 1 day later**

&amp;#x200B;

So I think my original post must have been shared on Facebook or something, because my phone has been blowing up. It's mostly mutual friends and acquaintances asking if I posted it, I'd told a few people about how I'd caught her cheating and I guess it wasn't hard to put 2 and 2 together. My ex also tried to call me about a hundred times. I know she knows my throwaway username because she sent me a screenshot of the post along with a long, abusive message threatening all sorts of things. I blocked her everywhere after that.

I want to clear a few things up:

Going through her phone was wrong, I get that. To be honest it's the first time I've ever done anything like that in a relationship, and it was only because there were so many things that gave me bad vibes (e.g., late nights out with vague explanations, being caught in various lies, sleeping with her phone under her pillow or leaving it face down on the charger, etc).

I left the apartment because my ex has a history of violent histrionics when she doesn't get her way. I didn't want to put myself in a compromising situation where she could either hurt me or make up stories about me hurting her. I had a bug-out bag packed and ready to go before I hit send on the message just in case.

She didn't do any real damage to the apartment, just threw my stuff around while having a tantrum. It took a few hours to clear up and nothing valuable was damaged, so I figured it was easier to just let it slide.

I had to stay in contact with her while we divided up our joint finances, furniture, and various other stuff accumulated over a four year relationship. As of yesterday that's all done, which is why I waited several weeks to make the initial post. She is now blocked everywhere.

Yes, I took the cat with me. We've both been crashing at my friend's place while I look for a new apartment. He's doing great. He was always my pet anyway, my ex tolerated him (at best).

I told my ex that I was the one who sent the message because I wanted her to know. I suppose I could have played that hand differently, but I wanted the satisfaction of seeing the look on her face when she found out. It didn't feel that great in hindsight, I'd probably go back and do that differently if I could.

I wasn't planning on airing her dirty laundry on social media (does reddit count?) because I wanted to be above that sort of juvenile bullshit, but it seems like the horse has bolted on that now. People know.

I don't think there'll be much else to update on after this - I don't intend to ever speak to her again, and I doubt her ugly little man has the backbone to come after me.

J - I know you're reading this. I hope you also read all the comments in the first post, they were savage. You're disgusting, and I am so glad I was able to see your true colors before I wasted any more of my life on you. Good luck with the pathetic goblin you chose over me, I don't know if I should feel more sorry for him or for you. In any case, people of your quality deserve to be together.

Oh, and A, she's all yours now buddy. Good luck with that.

*Good for you! Continue to move forward and don't let anyone make you doubt yourself for a second that fooling that violent cheater into showing her true face was wrong.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok-Draft9581**

*Agreed! You did the right thing. It's good that she showed her true colors. Keep moving forward and don't let her negativity bring you down.*

Among his peculiar habits were drinking water from puddles, smoking animal dung, and consuming roadkill, with his preference being rotting porcupines.

Despite his unhygienic lifestyle, he lived to the age of 94. Shortly before his passing, nearby villagers persuaded him to bathe, marking his first bath since the 1960s.

5437,To the spiciest chicken nugget... Thank you for being my best friend. This pain is unbearable. ,"Molly Potato H
Feb '09- Sept 24, 2024

Oh Mollo
You have been with me through so much...Recovering from intense surgeries, bone marrow biopsies, collapsed lungs, strokes, an abusive relationship, faith crisis, multiple bouts of sepsis, suicidal ideation, kidney transplant, grief, loss of loved ones and so much more. You've not only helped me, but every member of our family through some of the hardest times in our lives. 

You always found a way to make us laugh with your goofy antics. 
You showed me love when I didn't believe I was deserving of it. 
You were my constant shadow and confidant. 
You were the reason I got up most days. 
You saved my life, time and time again. 

15 years and 7 months is a long time... But I selfishly wish we had more time together. I use to roll my eyes at people who called themselves ""dog moms"", but you were the closest thing to a child that I'll ever have in this life.

Just like you've loved every version of me, I have loved every version of you. Even this last one, as hard as it's been, struggling with doggy dementia, severe arthritis, pain and health issues. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

The unconditional love you've shown me is a gift I'll forever be grateful for. I feel incredibly lucky to have known and felt this kind of love. 

To say I'll miss you is an understatement, and I'm not sure how to live without you. You were truly my soul dog, and have taken a piece of me with you. 
Thank you for being my best friend.",/r/DOG/comments/1fr58q3/to_the_spiciest_chicken_nugget_thank_you_for/

Where actresses like Tripti , Mrunal , Sanya ,Wamiqa gets item songs and pathetic roles. Bollywood is partial.","These YouTube perfectly described the partiality which is going on Bollywood.

People here bash Deepika because of her doing big budget movies like Kalki and Fighter. Bro, she isn't a nepo. If she delivers a flop, she won't get more movies and loose her position in the top , that's why to remain in top , she is doing safe choice. She doesn't have Karan Johar to back her up even she delivers flops. Like Rocky aur Rani ki prem kahani wasn't even a blockbuster or a good role for Alia , still it got paid reviews and paid awards. Everybody mentions Chapaak , Nobody mentions Sadak and Kalank. If DP did Kalank or a sub flop, it would have been writen all over but DP did 3 successful movies with SLB only.

Alia bhatt is getting all female lead solo scripts writen for her like Jigra , a tailor made role for her , Jahnvi inspite of bad acting got movies like Mili, Goodluck Jerry , Ulajh , but she is bad in acting that's why all those flopped.

But one if gets good movies even after so many flops , they will get better eventually.

Sara got Ae watan mere watan , just imagine if the same movie was given to Sanya or Mrunal they would have done justice to this movie.

They give all nepos the best scripts and then act like oh they are doing female lead solo movie and they are so good.

They gave shitty movies like Bad newz to Tripti. Such a pathetic song. Tripti is such a great actor , she already proved her mettle in acting with performance like Bulbbul and Qala. Why Karan Johar gives movie like Jigra to Tripti ? Or Mrunal ? Or Sanya?
Or even Kriti Sanon?


Nepotism is ruining Bollywood.

5463,"This post from May 2023: ""The new CBA agreement will make it almost impossible for the Timberwolves to keep both KAT and Gobert on the roster together after the 2023-2024 season. Or, why a KAT or Gobert trade in the next year is practically a reality.""","[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13wp5q1/the_new_cba_agreement_will_make_it_almost/)

&gt; TL;DR; the cost of the Timberwolves' top four of KAT, Gobert, Ant, and McDaniels alone will put the Timberwolves over the cap in 2024. To sign their draft 2024 FRP, extensions for players like Naz Reid and NAW, and simply filling out the rest of the roster with vet minimum contracts, they will trigger the CBA's new second luxury tax apron. This apron is so punitive and restrictive that it will make breaching that threshold cost-prohibitively expensive to do so, unless you are a team with a surefire championship contending roster, which the Timberwolves are not. As a result, a KAT or Gobert trade in the next year is almost impossible to avoid.

5471,Brian Thomas Jr.: A Sneaky Buy Before His Breakout,"Brian Thomas Jr. has flown under the radar, overshadowed by elite prospects like Nabers and Harrison. Those prospects are in their own league but Brian Thomas Jr would have been a top prospect in any other class. He's an athletic freak with a 9.97 RAS, ranking 10th out of 3,063 WRs from 1987 to 2024. Drafted early by the Jaguars, he was declared a starter right away and has played more than 75% of the snaps for them since week 1. 

Through three weeks, he's tied for the team‚Äôs highest target share alongside Christian Kirk. Metrics-wise, Thomas has an elite [2.1 yards per route run](https://x.com/TylerMWeiss_/status/1838648273420325040), which is a strong indicator of success‚Äîonly trailing Nabers and Bowers among rookies. His [first read target share](https://x.com/FantasyPtsData/status/1839999749598130256) sits at 20.9%, 3rd among rookies behind Nabers, Ladd, and Harrison. Other metrics like separation, listed [here](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/brian-thomas-jr/), also show he's excelling.

Rookie breakouts often take time, and we‚Äôve been spoiled by guys like Puka and Nabers this season. Even elite talents like Justin Jefferson didn‚Äôt light it up immediately. Now‚Äôs the perfect time to buy in on Brian Thomas Jr. before he fully breaks out. Kirk will continue thriving in the slot, but Gabe Davis has been invisible and is dealing with a shoulder injury, while Evan Engram is still out. There's not much competition behind them. All the peripherals are great for BT and its a matter of time till he takes the next step. I understand there is concern with Lawrence and coaching but that is already priced in to his value. 

The breakout is coming‚Äîbuy low now before he blows up. He wont be Nabers or Harrison but a great value as a WR2 with occasional blow up games.",/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1frq3u6/brian_thomas_jr_a_sneaky_buy_before_his_breakout/

I could take the joking around, but he tended to punch down, and had a habit of implying younger people (like me)  weren't just inexperienced, but stupid.

One day he decided to screw with me in a ridiculously obvious way, and sent me to the garage next door for muffler bearings and a sky hook. 

Now, I was young, but I'd heard this joke before. My own dad once tried to send me for striped paint. 

So i acted innocent, said okay, and went over to the garage.

When i got to the counter, i told the owner what was going on and asked for a big box with some old, useless parts. 

I then asked if he could write out a bill for like, $1,800 dollars, and stamp it ""non-refundable, final sale"".

I lugged that 50 pound box back to our shop, plunked it on the table, and handed the bill to our boss who happened to be talking to the guy who sent me. ""Here ya go, Larry. Garage owner says he wants payment today"".

""Larry"" did NOT get the last laugh on that one...",/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1frhqys/the_old_go_get_some_muffler_bearings_trick/

5593,Terrible idea to do a roast for GAS,"Just felt like a disgraceful episode. The reading mini challenge already displayed the unfair playing field between English-speaking and ESL queens. As the queens said, a roast is not a thing in every country. I felt nervous to even watch this episode because I knew the non-RuGirls would struggle with this challenge.

Also, what the hell was that ‚Äúmaster class‚Äù? On a regular season, the queens get a private session where they workshop their jokes and get feedback? Instead in GAS they sit around the couch and Graham tells them to remember to be funny? If they at least got some coaching, it would‚Äôve been a teensy bit fairer.

I really thought they were setting up the narrative for Nelly to win this one, as they pointed out she hadn‚Äôt won yet, and then killed it during the roast. Even just from a narrative/producer perspective, it makes no sense to give another win to two of the English-speaking queens.

Sad that Pythia can also get a laugh when (once again) she has to play down to a stereotype.

The whole episode (and this whole series) just feels like an exercise in punching down. WTAF.

No instructions for checkout or trash removal (large building, not obvious where trash removal happens) so we figured that stuff was part of the cleaner's job. We put the dirty dishes in the sink, made sure all trash was in bags, and left. Host wrote a review basically making it sound like we destroyed the place. Sounds like our crimes were 1) leaving a blanket on the floor, 2) not noticing an earplug that had rolled under the bed, and 3) not scrubbing the bathroom. Per the host, this disgusting mess made her want to quit AirBnB, which honestly she probably should. 

I can respond to the review, but there's no way to do so without coming across as defensive or petty, so I basically just have to live with it, which makes me irrationally angry.",/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1fr8tne/airbnb_host_gave_us_a_bad_review_for_not/

5612,Update on broken leg bun ‚Äì not sure what to do :(,"Providing an update to my last post about broken tibia 11 year old bun‚Ä¶

I brought her to the vet this morning for a follow up appointment (4 days after splinting).

The vet basically said the cast has slipped barely (perhaps less than a 1/8 inch‚Ä¶) but because of that, it‚Äôs kinda unlikely it will heal.

She said I could amputate it but that would be a $2000 surgery, anesthesia would come with many risks to her &amp; she certainly would not enjoy recovery. So end of life services were noted. I asked the vet what she would do if this was her bunny, and she said she would consider surgery if she &amp; her husband were rich but with an 11.5 year old bunny, she might choose end of life services. 

I am just so conflicted because I really don‚Äôt want her to go through an amputation at 11.5 but also, I feel like her bones have a chance of healing despite what the veterinarian said‚Ä¶ When my bunny was young, she broke her front leg and it healed in a few weeks of cage rest.

If this were your bunny, what would you do?? I don‚Äôt know if I should try to let her heal for a few weeks with the splint and get xrays, remove the splint since it slipped but try to let her heal with no splint and see if it heals by itself, or euthanize‚Ä¶ Really against amputation because of her age &amp; I think that would be really hard on her but open to thoughts.

5619,I took a shower at midnight while my wife was watching TV. Who‚Äôs the AH?,"My wife was sitting in the recliner watching her iPad right outride the kids bedrooms. I figure I‚Äôm in the clear to take a long shower. When I turn the shower off I hear my 3 year old crying and screaming for daddy. I hurry. 

As I‚Äôm going through the family room, I look at my wife (sitting watching her iPad) and say, ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt calm him down?‚Äù She says, ‚ÄúNo, I tried three times.‚Äù

I go into his room and pick him up. He immediately stops crying and starts trying to catch his breath. I feel what I thought were tears dripping down my shoulder. I think: ‚Äúpoor guy has been so upset for so long; long enough for my wife to come in three times.‚Äù

I lay him in bed and start tucking him in. He says, I have a mess. I figure tears and snot. I grab wipes and tissue, and turn the flashlight on my phone on. 

That‚Äôs when I realized he was covered in blood. His first bloody nose, and it was bad: all over his face, arms, clothes, stuffy, blanket - and I‚Äôm covered. Those were not tears dripping down my shoulder.

I get him cleaned up, and asked my wife to shout the bloody items while I get him cleaned up. I‚Äôm tucking him in and I ask why he didn‚Äôt let mommy help. He said, ‚ÄúMommy didn‚Äôt check on me. Somebody never checked on me.‚Äù

Now my wife is pissed at me for me expecting her to help. I‚Äôm pissed at her for not taking care of our son while I‚Äôm in the shower and she‚Äôs watching her iPad, and I‚Äôm pissed that she‚Äôs pissed I expected her to help.

5679,"I reached Level 325, all skills level 4 and all powers level 10 - And my point of view on that!","First of all, this is my view on this feat, and no, I definitely don't recommend it to anyone. I really like Starfield and the paths that opened up for its future with the updates that came after its release, but that doesn't stop me from criticizing what I find really traumatic about the game. Many people complain about the travel system, loading times, and the quality of random NPCs, but for most of my play this wasn't a problem.

[Level 325 - Skills Level 4 - Power Level 10](https://preview.redd.it/eixpn8jfvkrd1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31e19c265f44ca6886452e453fa7063ca91f3dd5)

My game went as follows: I initially carried out a mix between the main mission and faction missions so that the discovery of that universe happened in a very organic way, while learning more about various game mechanics. This also happened with the completion of many side quests. After finishing my base game, I felt the urge to play an NG+ game for the first time, repeating the main story and factions, having fun because I already knew what was going to happen and using the Starborns' dialogue options.

After finishing the game for the second time, a question came to me that basically led me here:

And if?

What if I decided to know all the Starborn costumes and managed to get them all to maximum level? It would be interesting and so, NG+ followed by NG+, making all the temples in each of them and skipping the main mission, after a lot of effort, when arriving at NG+13, seeing some alternative universes, the mission was accomplished. Now it was definitely an extremely powerful Starborns, since, even though it wasn't well detailed by Bethesda, the power upgrades really break any difficulty in the game, but it's up to the player to use them or not.

It was then time to rest, or maybe not... I realized that I hadn't platinumized the game since even after all this effort, many missions, several NG+, visited an absurd 249 Temples, I was level 80 and would need to reach level 100 .

Here I really genuinely discovered what Starfield's most significant problem is: its completely broken level system.

Right here on Reddit I researched ways to reach level 100, including farming in outposts, creating chemicals, and finally, farming Foxbats, which was the method I used.

Anyway, I reached level 100, game duly platinum, probably a good 350 hours, an extremely positive experience, despite its problems.

But here again the tremendous question appeared in my mind:

And if?

What if you, with maybe about 4 months left until the DLC, tried to reach the level necessary to unlock all level 4 skills? I didn't want to use mods in my game because I imagined (correctly) that new achievements would come and I wanted to do them in it. So since we have that time, let's go to the mission. First of all, how to get to level 325? I optimized the farm in every possible way using the mass murder of Foxbats, which resulted in almost 30,000 of them being properly exterminated. A lot of ammunition wasted, a lot of money, a lot of dedication to creating level-up goals and stopping to invest skill points as they accumulated 30 or 40.

Understand, it's not a good system, it's not well done, it's not organic, it's not fair, but yes, I did it. And I'm happy with the result, because yesterday, September 27, 2024, I finally finished what I wanted to do in Starfield before the Shattered Space DLC.

This inevitably returns me to what I consider Starfield's biggest problem:

Starfield is a game hidden within the immensity of itself.

From the moment I started to level up different skills, the game changed drastically, several new items could be made, new options, combat improvements, manipulation systems, instigation, pacification, ways to play stealth, incredible customization of weapons, costumes, ships, outposts...

The game simply hides this from 95% of everyone who plays because of a completely wrong level system. Bethesda has always created great stories, and you often spend a lot of time on a mission that gives you 250 experience points, while a simple kill of a foxbat gave me approximately 320 experience points.

And you add this to a series of basic skills that need to be released and upgraded almost necessarily, such as greater carrying capacity, using a backpack, some basic ballistics, trading. These points prevent the player from investing in what he would really like.

I'm not saying it has to be easy or that nothing should be prioritized, but the way Starfield is, you don't even have enough points to specialize in something if you don't really stop to focus on leveling up.

I hope that Bethesda one day fixes this so that many people can see how incredible and hidden Starfield is within itself, whether by removing the need to use experience points in the skill system, leaving only the requirements, or adjusting the experience obtained so that it happens more organically.

Records made, I can only reaffirm that I love this game, that I am very excited for the DLC and after all these events, I will venture out with some very interesting mods, but leaving this game of mine, for which I have great affection, always recorded.

To those who have read this far, thank you, I hope it inspires you in some way and good luck on your new journey! See you in the stars!

5688,My Valentine‚Äôs Day Abortion (Why I chose an abortion I didn‚Äôt want and its nuances.),"**My Valentine‚Äôs Day Abortion**
\
*Why I chose an abortion I didn‚Äôt want and its nuances.*

**Disclaimer: Every abortion is different. This is my unique personal experience of a first trimester medical abortion, NOT to be taken as medical advice. I‚Äôll share some details of things I wish I had known.**
\
**I feel both sad and relieved about my decision. I don‚Äôt regret my choice.** 

**September 28, 2024:**

Today is the due date of a child that I would have loved to have.
\
Instead, I‚Äôm sharing my abortion story.

Before everything quickly happened, I had been with my husband for over 15 years. We never had any accidents and thought we‚Äôd never need an abortion.

**January 30, 2024:**

As soon as I saw the school email calling for volunteers for my first grader‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day activities, I signed up! 

I love my two children very dearly, both planned, but I wanted more kids. I never wanted to deceive my husband, so I could only try to convince him. He refused and was resolute. After a few years I stopped mentioning it at all, occasionally grieving a bit silently when I saw larger families. 

**January 31:**

I sat in the doctor‚Äôs office describing my health symptoms of the last month. I started to have a new type of pain that got very severe sometimes. She told me they would have to put me under anesthesia for a procedure to find the cause, casually mentioning that they do a pregnancy test right before, as the procedure can‚Äôt be done when pregnant.

‚ÄúThere is no way I‚Äôm pregnant. 0% chance!‚Äù I told the doctor. I was super confident!

**February 6:**

The morning of the procedure my period still didn‚Äôt come. I was not surprised as my period had been delayed in the recent months from my weight loss, something I‚Äôve dealt with before. There was an old pregnancy test in the bathroom. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt hurt to check!‚Äù I reasoned and opened the box. 

When a bright ‚Äú+‚Äù popped up I was stunned. How could this have happened? I always took huge margins into consideration to avoid my ovulation days. 

Frantically I tried to reach the doctors and nurses. I begged the nurse to have me still come in to do the procedure as I was in a lot of pain. But she said they must refuse pregnant patients, even if I planned to terminate. Later I realized they would use highly potent medications, including fentanyl, that could cause serious birth defects. 

I called my husband. He came home right away and we weighed our options. I could either continue the pregnancy with my unknown health issue or terminate the pregnancy. 

As much as I would have loved to carry another child, I was terrified to physically and mentally also carry my undiagnosed illness for at least 7 more months. What if it were something that needed urgent medical intervention? The pregnancy might also exacerbate my pain and that would require a lot of pain medication if not more. 

I also could not face the risks associated with growing a child inside me while taking medication. Knowingly inflicting possible lifelong health consequences on the child is too cruel.

My current children deserve to grow up with a healthy mother. I needed to get healthier. That was my priority. 

Even though making the decision was completely logical and quick for me, I was devastated for what it could have been: a third child I dreamed of having. How unfair was fate to coincide my unknown illness with the best surprise in my life in any other circumstance? But I was at peace with my decision.

We had no idea how far along I was. Regardless, we tried to book the earliest abortion appointment to minimize its development. EVEN DEEP IN A BLUE STATE, THE FASTEST APPOINTMENT WAS 6 DAYS LATER for us! I couldn‚Äôt imagine how long the wait would be close to the border with states that banned abortion or living in such states! 

**February 12:**

I stepped into the abortion clinic. I paid about $600 and asked what if someone can‚Äôt pay. They said they have ways to help cover the expenses if needed. 

The first step was to confirm the pregnancy with a transvaginal ultrasound since it was likely too small for an abdominal ultrasound. I remember fondly the ultrasounds of my previous children. This time, I still had a lot of anticipation to see the fetus, but to say goodbye.

When the ultrasound technician asked me ‚Äúdo you want a picture?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù 

She started the ultrasound, in silence.
\
‚ÄúHow old is it?‚Äù I asked.
\
‚Äú7 weeks 2 days.‚Äù She was terse, but my mind was racing. In the first trimester, embryos grow at basically the same rate so they could pinpoint its age. I thought it would be older than this, but I guess irregular periods really mess up ovulation times. 

I started to imagine what it would look like when she would finally turn the screen for me, would it already have fingers and toes like some anti-abortion websites showed? 

Suddenly she turned her head aside from the screen and pushed away the control panel. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over?!‚Äù I asked.
\
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù 
\
I was heartbroken that I didn‚Äôt get the chance to say goodbye to the fetus on the screen! Later I wish I had asked her to turn it on for me one more time. 

She handed me a blurry ultrasound picture with just a tiny stub. I tried to look for any human features but couldn‚Äôt see anything. It was only 1.11 cm long, less than half an inch. Later I learned at 7 weeks 2 days it was an embryo where the face and limbs were just starting to form (Footnote 1). So I realized the ANTI-ABORTION WEBSITES WERE PUTTING PICTURES OF MUCH OLDER FETUSES for 7 and 8 weeks to deceive viewers!! 

In the next room a nurse asked if I was sure I wanted to go through with the abortion and if it was my sole decision. I confirmed and she started to explain the medications, mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone stops the embryo from growing and most people don‚Äôt feel anything from it (like in my case).

She went outside to get the mifepristone, which came in a little orange box, one I‚Äôve seen online before but never thought I would need. Staring at the box, reality overwhelmed me for a moment and a single tear rolled down. The nurse saw it and asked ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù What could I say? How I wished it would not be this way, but it was for the best of everyone, including the embryo in my opinion. 

‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

She asked me one last time if I was sure, then I drank down the mifepristone.

I walked out of the clinic with a bag containing the rest of my medications: ibuprofen and misoprostol, and a prescription of a second course if the first one failed.

**February 13:**

The morning of the next day, as instructed, I took the ibuprofen and waited 30 minutes to start the misoprostol. I was told I could either deliver the drug vaginally or buccally (in the cheek), and neither way is better. I reasoned that being close to the target might be advantageous, so I followed the instructions for placing the pills vaginally and laid down for 30 minutes. Not all pills dissolved afterwards but enough would be absorbed in the 30 minutes (unfortunately I was in the small minority that it didn‚Äôt work). I should anticipate cramping within 4 hours and then a heavier-than-normal period. 

I realized I was never told exactly what to look for in ‚Äúpassing the pregnancy‚Äù when my cramping started and small clumps of blood came out, like a period. In the afternoon I felt like the bleeding tapered off a bit. Just in case, I used the prescription paper to get a second course of misoprostol at my pharmacy.

**February 14:**

It was Valentine‚Äôs Day and I still wanted to volunteer at my son‚Äôs class, but I woke up not knowing if the abortion was finished or not. So I called the nurse describing how much I bled and asked her if my medical abortion was successful. She couldn‚Äôt give me a definitive answer! (I would find out why.)

Since it was better safe than sorry, I took the second dose. This time I took it buccally in my cheeks for 30 minutes. Again not all pills dissolved afterwards, but I drank the rest per instructions. About 2 hours in, the cramping started. Within an hour the bleeding was so frequent that I stayed in the bathroom until I passed a lemon sized sac. I definitively knew I passed the pregnancy. 

I realized a reason why none of the nurses told me what to look for when passing the pregnancy might be because it could have easily slipped into the bathroom, undetected! 

The frequent bleeding stopped in a few minutes and I felt comfortable just with a pad now. After a week of light period bleeding, I had spotting for a few more days. For me, it was 100 times physically easier than giving birth, where I took painkillers for extreme uterine cramps for days, and had genital pain and heavy bleeding for weeks. (Luckily my genital area healed completely after each birth, a few people I know were not so lucky.)

The time was just past 2:30 pm. I could still make it to my son‚Äôs school! As I was driving, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but my heart was heavy. The school was a perfect distraction. I handed out little stickers, helped clean up their crafts, and took pictures of a classroom full of laughing kids to share with their parents. They had no idea how much I needed their smiles and hugs that afternoon.

**Epilogue:**

My illness was diagnosed when I was cleared to go under anesthesia. While not cancerous, I was lucky to have caught it still at an early stage, when there were no permanent damages yet. After a few more months, I was grateful to finally be pain-free. If I had continued the pregnancy, it would have exacerbated my condition to the point where I might not have had a complete recovery. I cannot imagine how much more severe pain I would have endured. I am grateful that I had the choice to not be tortured this way.

With long abortion clinic wait times in many cases, A 6-WEEK ABORTION BAN IS EFFECTIVELY A COMPLETE ABORTION BAN for many women and girls, especially those with irregular periods or accidental pregnancies who might not find out they‚Äôre pregnant until week 6 like in my case or even later! After finding out, the wait time might be another week or longer for places with higher demand. Even deep in a blue state, the earliest I could book was in the following week.

Without my abortion I might very well have to endure lifelong health consequences from a delayed treatment. Abortion is healthcare. Every woman or girl deserves to make their own health choices.

Neither she nor my dad went to college.  My mom was also a devout and rather gullible Christian (the kind who sent money to televangelists), which didn't help. Suffice it to say, they weren't the most forward-thinking folks. To wit, the following nuggets of wisdom that I (thankfully) didn't listen to...

* Computers are a waste of time. They're a fad and won't be around in another 10 years because doing things on paper is just better.
* Don't try too hard to ""make things happen"" in your life/career.  If you encounter resistance, it's because God is telling you to go a different direction. 
* You just got a perfectly good $8.50/hour retail job, you won't need to go to college. 
* Don't pay attention to things like stocks, IRAs, and that sort of thing. Those are for rich people and it isn't ""real money"" anyway (as opposed to the weekly $250 paycheck from your job). 

What about you? What advice did you get as a young Gen-Xer that turned out to be terrible or way off base?





ADDENDUM: Perhaps my ""favorite"" bad advice was given to my wife (also Gen-X) by her high school guidance counselor: ""You don't really have a knack for academics. You should join the Army and become a mechanic."" For the record, she now has a Ph.D., a couple of Masters degrees, is widely cited and published and is a full professor at a one of the most famous science- and engineering-focused universities in the U.S... oh, and she's in a science documentary that's most likely getting picked up by Netflix for next year.

https://preview.redd.it/sgp1urr2cjrd1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93dae71a960d7d4222480c7b7401385b024e60e

I'm Cybrxkhan, creator of the [Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (RICE)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2273832430) mod, which adds simple ""Flavor Packs'' to different parts of the world. Today, I‚Äôll discuss RICE‚Äôs next flavor pack, **Lesbos: Island of Poets**. It will be released alongside RICE‚Äôs official update to the Roads to Power DLC and patch that was recently released. Please note all screenshots here are WIP.

I‚Äôm currently very busy IRL, so I cannot guarantee when this will be out due to the work required to update to the new DLC/patch. **The ETA for this update is around 2-4 weeks, but could be as early as 1 week**.

Lastly, if you‚Äôve played the VIET or RICE mods before, please consider taking the [2024 VIET/RICE survey](https://forms.gle/cYfCUFzzZgRDba5a6), which will close later in October. It is your chance to provide feedback on these mods, and at the end of the survey is an opportunity for you to vote\* for your pick for a future Celtic flavor pack for next year.

Feel free to check[ my mods' website](https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/),[ discord](https://discord.gg/9KuyXv2uZA), and[ twitter](https://twitter.com/Cybrxkhans_Mods) for more info, previews, and updates!

# MEDITERRANEAN PIRACY

This update will revamp RICE's old pirate mechanic from the Socotra Flavor Pack, introduced more than three and a half years ago. Besides minor changes to how the Indian Ocean pirate content works, the Mediterranean region now also gets its own version of the pirate content.

# Pirate Dens



https://preview.redd.it/8xjfb6lpajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=374d4d1fb0bc95df9e0addc9d427cd995c989fff

For instance, similarly to how the Indian Ocean pirates worked, you can now **Collaborate with Mediterranean Pirates** if you own a coastal county in the Mediterranean, which will place a **Mediterranean Pirate Den** in a coastal province of your capital. It is functionally similar to the Indian Ocean Pirate Den previously added in RICE, boosting income among other bonuses (and maluses).



https://preview.redd.it/mnivzwfqajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e359551d311b492b014e5169c7dc0d9a65a0bf7

At the start of the game, depending on the start date, some counties in the Mediterranean already have this special building. For example, the capitals of the Italian Republics like Venice, Genoa, and Pisa have them in every start date, to represent their heavy involvement in piracy against both Christian and Muslim regions. After all, just like in the Indian Ocean, the line between a merchant and a pirate could be very blurry during this time period.

# Contacting Pirates

A major expansion on the old pirate content is a decision to **Contact Mediterranean Pirates** or **Contact Indian Ocean Pirates**, depending on where you are. It has various options to select that provide different boons, such as a lump sum of gold from acquiring pirate booty. For all these options other than Ransom Captives, instead of paying gold for goodies, you pay in legitimacy and prestige. Ransom Captives conversely gives you legitimacy at the cost of gold.¬†

The options are:

* Establish Relations
* Acquire Booty
* Authorize Sales
* Recruit Corsairs
* Ransom Captives



https://preview.redd.it/u3om7z3sajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421404840381d90aa4e0d0f2805ef21c15290507

Do note that every option other than the first requires either you to have taken the Establish Contact option or to own a county with the relevant Pirate Den building. If you do the former, you'll get a modifier that'll grant you access to the latter four options for 10 years only. As such, if you want to take advantage of the pirates long-term, you may consider taking the Collaboration decision to get a pirate den.



https://preview.redd.it/t7w6ghssajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2587e752c7e4e6698e4b808547b86df230d7a9c6

Pirates infested the Mediterranean for centuries, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation, and just like in the Indian Ocean, rulers sought to make use of them. For instance, the Gattilusio family, who had ties with both the Republic of Genoa and the Byzantine Empire and ruled Lesbos in the 1300s and 1400s, was the main inspiration for the revamped pirate content as they were notorious for working with pirates.

# Pirate Innovations

A couple newly added innovations have bonuses related to pirates.¬†

**Monsoon Trade Routes**, available in the Indian Ocean, improves naval speed, reduces sea danger, and reduces the cooldown for the decisions to Contact Indian Ocean Pirates and Reinforce Relations with Silk Road Communities.

**Dragomans**, available in the Mediterranean, reduces the language learning scheme duration, increases diplomatic range, and reduces how much legitimacy you lose when taking the decision to Contact Mediterranean Pirates.



https://preview.redd.it/kouqudfhbjrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07154188ee9b4ee7428f97cd283c5093b6a3a303

# KALENDS

As with many RICE updates, the Lesbos flavor pack introduces general flavor for a broader cultural or religious group. This time, it's a new activity for rulers who are Hellenic pagan or of a Byzantine culture: **Kalends**, short for the Kalends of January, or Kalandai in medieval Greek.



https://preview.redd.it/s63sbqwuajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f1a540970ba7fd3032d2a1a8f0366cee5a6580e

In ancient Rome, the Kalends of January was a festival to start the new year. Though other ancient Roman customs fell out of fashion, the Kalends retained its popularity into the Byzantine era, when it was reinterpreted as a mirthful holiday. Some Byzantine clergy condemned it as a pagan practice, but among Greek Christians living under Muslim rule, it conversely became a more sacred holiday and a marker of Christian identity. The holiday likely disappeared sometime by the 14th century.

The Kalends is similar to RICE‚Äôs other festival activities. Its main bonuses are increased opinion with attendees, and the potential to gain beneficial county modifiers. One little twist is if any of your lieges above you are not your religion, you gain extra piety if you take the Religious intent.

# Miscellaneous Lesbos Content

The **Castle of Mytilene** is a special building in the county of Lesbos. It has two levels, and also represents the importance of Lesbos as a key point along the naval and maritime trade routes going into Constantinople.



https://preview.redd.it/hnf28revajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d55cba32d562f99981b9b3c1d09ec574b4db44

On a related note, a new minor decision is also now available to rulers with coastal counties in the Aegean Sea: **Fortify Aegean Territories**. It adds a useful county modifier improving your defenses in all coastal counties you own in the Aegean Sea.



https://preview.redd.it/1oe9d04wajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d329fe3231968c1602547375ca8ce1c7dd9b79f9

No mention of Lesbos can go without hinting at the most famous person from there ‚Äì **Sappho**, the ancient Greek poet. Though her reception and image has evolved over the centuries, in modern times, she has become a symbol of love between women. While there won‚Äôt be any explicit mechanics related to her per se, she was known in medieval times, and there will be a few flavor events about her that can pop up even if you aren‚Äôt in Lesbos.

# NEW SICILY CONTENT

Now, let‚Äôs move on to other things besides the admittedly smaller Lesbos flavor pack.

This update includes new content that was originally planned for the Sicily flavor pack but scrapped for time. One is a new innovation: **Almadraba** (or Mattanza for Latin cultures). It unlocks a new decision, **Finance Almadraba Fishing**.



https://preview.redd.it/jy8grwtwajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f986cab884f57723d015c7d66b2297ab345e1e98

Almadraba is an old fishing technique prevalent in parts of Iberia, North Africa, and Italy. It involves setting up an elaborate series of nets to trap and catch large numbers of tuna when they annually migrate from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic. Rulers in the western Mediterranean could profit from supporting and monopolizing this industry, like the Dukes of Medina-Sidonia in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Additionally, the Siculo-Arabic culture‚Äôs Religious Blending and Culture Blending traditions have been replaced with a new tradition, **Contentious Colonizers**.



https://preview.redd.it/2hzoawgxajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5548965c1241c0b538a794d1db9cd061dcfb0e4

It provides various bonuses and maluses reflecting the history of Muslim Sicily. It‚Äôs also a way to recruit the Siqillian Archers Men-at-arms that previously could only be accessed via the Recruit Sicilian Soldiers decision.

# LANDLESS CHARACTER

# Changes to Existing Characters

Roads to Power DLC adds landless adventurers, and RICE will add a few that you can play if you have the DLC. Some are RICE characters who were added previously. These include:

* Thabit ibn Qurra (867)
* Hiwi al-Balkhi (867)
* al-Kashgari (1066)
* Ibn Nabhan (1066)
* Nasir Khusraw (1066)
* Longibardopoulos (1066)



https://preview.redd.it/fk15qwqyajrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7bcddd68a497269bbb947e2e9ecf2a6dd6469fd

If you don't have the Roads to Power DLC, Thabit ibn-Qurra, al-Kashgari, and Ibn Nabhan are still playable like before, just not as adventurers. The option of start them off as landed will remain, even if you have the DLC. However, Other landless characters mentioned in this dev diary will be unlanded and thus unplayable without the DLC for now, but I may make them landed without the DLC in the future once I have time.

# New Landless Characters

Many new historical landless characters will also be added in various start dates as well. Most are new characters, though a few are vanilla but were previously courtiers (in asterisks). Generally, I focused on adding those connected geographically to previous flavor packs I‚Äôve done in some way, instead of just adding in everyone, to make this more manageable.

Right now, the added landless characters include the below. How many do you recognize?

* Plausible fictitious Korean in Dunhuang (867)
* Ibn Wahshiyya (867)
* Cynewulf (867)¬†
* Al-Balkhi (867)
* Eldad ha-Dani (867)
* Wulfstan of Hedeby (867)
* Ottar (Ohthere) av H√•logaland\* (867)
* Ali Kalbid\* (867)
* Fu Murong\* (867)
* Bartholomew Leslie (1066)
* Chakrapani Datta (1066)
* al-Wuhsha al-Dallala (1066)
* Tzachas (1066)
* Japheth ibn Bundar (1066)
* Ibn al-Qatta‚Äô al-Siqilli (1066)
* Trapelicino (1178)
* Hafsa bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya (1178)
* Li Shichang (1178)
* Michael Scot (1178)
* Oranmiyan (1178)
* Hugo von Hildesheim (1178)
* Guglielmo Grasso (1178)
* Plausible fictitious Malays in the Indian Ocean (all dates)
* Plausible fictitious Swahili in the Indian Ocean (all dates)
* Plausible fictitious Soninke Wangara merchants (all dates)

More may be added before release. As I can't add every interesting character out there, when I‚Äôve more time at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, I‚Äôll look at adding more historical landless characters and improving RICE‚Äôs existing landless characters with flavor events and additional content, similar to some of the vanilla landless characters with historical event chains.



https://preview.redd.it/hmfzm5t1bjrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24176eb5d6987e47716b35cfe7e560da894e1a2f

# NEW BOOKMARKS

The new vanilla patch adds a 1178 start date. RICE will come with bookmarks for the Western, Middle Eastern, and Eastern parts of the map in 1178, and one for landless 1178 adventurers, highlighting interesting figures if you play with RICE.

* **Constance**, the Duchess of Brittany who had to balance competing French and English interests
* **Margaritu of Brindisi**, a Greek pirate turned admiral of the Kingdom of Sicily
* **Parakramabahu**, King of Sri Lanka who was an extensive builder and Buddhist religious reformer
* **Motolomi**, legendary conqueror and pagan king of Damot in southern Ethiopia
* **al-Nasir**, the last Abbasid Caliph with any degree of independent authority
* **Yelu Zhilugu**, the penultimate ruler of the Kara-Khitai
* **Wo Daochong**, prime minister of Western Xia and a Confucian scholar
* **Temujin**, the future Genghis Khan, the great conqueror who needs no introduction

# Landless Bookmarks

New bookmarks have also been added for landless characters in 867 and 1066. Some previously bookmarked characters from those start dates have been moved to these if they are now adventurers instead of landed. Bookmarked landless characters are:

* 867: Thabit ibn Qurra, Rollo, Ibn Wahshiyya
* 1066: al-Kashgari, Al-Wuhsha Al-Dallala, Tzachas
* 1178: Michael Scot, Oranmiyan, Trapelicino, Ikhtiyar al-Din, Hafsa al-Rukuniyya

There are a lot of interesting characters here, and I‚Äôll share more about them and the other new unbookmarked characters in some previews and teasers on my discord, twitter, etc. in the lead up to release!



https://preview.redd.it/nl388m33bjrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e4175aba07fd50d3b0c936cea2f4ee67c2334c

# CHARACTER FLAVOR

Some characters mentioned above will get a bit of special flavor.

# Historical Aspirations

In the interest of saving time, right now, only one character in 1178, Constance, will be given their own Historical Aspiration: **Secure Family's Rule Over Brittany**. It requires you to have an adult heir of your own dynasty, among other things.

For those who don‚Äôt know, RICE gives Historical Aspirations to some characters at game start. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúquests‚Äù you can complete to gain further rewards. In the future, more characters will be given Historical Aspirations in the 1178 start date.

# Ibn Wahshiyya

Ibn Wahshiyya is a playable landless scholar in 867. He gets his own unique trait, **The Nabataean**, with three tracks: Agriculture, Religion, and Folklore.



https://preview.redd.it/exweji55bjrd1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd716c78672c6a0916e1b8929842f244454de69

Like Thabit ibn Qurra featured in the old Harran Flavor Pack, Ibn Wahshiyya was a scholar from a declining minority in the Abbasid Empire: in this case, the Aramaic-speaking Nabataeans of Iraq, a distinct group from the more famous and ancient Nabataeans of the Levant. They‚Äôre now added in game as a **Nabati** culture, present in 867. I named them that instead of Nabataean to prevent confusion with the other Nabataeans. It accompanies RICE‚Äôs Kasdanian faith, representing the Nabataeans‚Äô late form of Mesopotamian paganism, added earlier this year.

How do you level up Ibn Wahshiyya‚Äôs trait? Whenever you travel as him, you'll have three additional travel options. Each provides a random chance of gaining xp in its associated track and a specific resource each time you go through a barony. That way, they're still useful even after you finish leveling up the trait.

* Study Agriculture (provisions if adventurer, and gold if not)
* Contemplate Religion (piety)
* Record Folklore (prestige)

Once you max out your trait, you can take a decision to **Compile Nabataean Lore** which will grant you a unique book artifact, **The Nabataean Agriculture**. This was Ibn Wahshiyya's magnum opus, highly regarded in its day and referenced by later historical scholars like Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, and Ibn Khaldun. Though mainly an agricultural treatise, it also provided information on topics like magic, astrology, and the lives of the Nabataeans of Iraq.

# Other Flavor

A few other characters have been given unique modifiers, too.

In 1066, **Bartholomew Leslie** gets the **Hungarian Scotsman** modifier. The legendary founder of the Scottish Clan Leslie, he was supposedly a nobleman from Hungary.

In 1178, **Hafsa al-Rukuniyya** gets the **Mourning Abu Ja'far** modifier. Her lover, Abu Ja‚Äôfar, was a fellow poet and official of the then governor of Granada, Uthman. The jealous governor, who desired Hafsa, got into conflict with Abu Ja‚Äôfar, leading to the latter‚Äôs execution. (Uthman, who happens to be an Almohad Prince, is alive in 1178 and is Hafsa's rival, as an aside.)

# THE 1.13 PATCH

That concludes today‚Äôs dev diary! Please note that, again, everything here is subject to change. As discussed earlier, the ETA for this update is around 2-4 weeks, but could be as early as 1 week.

Anyhow, I‚Äôm quite excited to get this out soon, and there‚Äôs plenty of other changes I didn‚Äôt have time to get to talk about today. Stay tuned for more previews on discord, twitter, and the forums!

5767,People aren't treating Chappell like a person,"I think what a lot of people are missing about empathizing with Chappell in this time is that it's not even just a mental health issue. It's an issue with being a person. It's so exceedingly evil that that popular response to Chappell cancelling her All Things Go appearance is not respect, empathy, and kindness, but rather a ""fuck you, do your job"" attitude. Who taught these people to be like this? 

I just can't imagine seeing someone clearly struggling under the weight of the expectations put upon them and reacting with vitriol instead of understanding. It's become increasingly and horrifyingly clear that people don't see celebrities as human beings anymore. Would you want to get up on stage and sing for people when you're feeling the pressure like she very obviously is? Would you even want to be in the audience for someone who was doing that? I wouldn't. 

However, I think the popular notion on this sub is that she needs to ""get a PR person"" and ""stop interacting with social media"" and I disagree. While the parasociality of her online fan interactions is definitely exacerbated by social media, I think her honesty and clarity is a breath of fresh air in a generation of increasingly fake and polished celebrity personas. Drag is not polished, it's real. It's why Ethel Cain is also such a refresher. I don't think Chappell should have to change to fight against this bullshit. I think fan culture and other celebrities should change first to continue pushing back against all of this.",/r/chappellroan/comments/1frhwsa/people_arent_treating_chappell_like_a_person/

Well, i had enough recently. I havent seen him in a long while, and decided to make him regret what he has done and said SEVERELY. He was complaining about never seeing me, so, i told him when i was gonna be in town so we could have lunch. When we met up outside my doctors office, i saw his face fall. I had knee braces on that i got from my doctor since he saw that hey, my knees need some support, as well as both my crutches, as it was a bad day full of walking. He immediately asked if i was in a car accident and i told him
""Well, i wouldnt be in this situation if you didnt tell the neurologists i was faking it."" In a very casual tone. He was silent until we got to my favorite restaurant where he asked for my symptoms for once, and told him that my legs feel like they have pillows and weights taped to them, the weights getting heavier each day, the only feeling i can feel without considerable force being what feels like you stuck your toe in an outlet, that getting stronger when i stand and walk. He realised that no. I was not faking it.

GameStop has increased its focus on PSA-graded cards and collectibles, tapping into the high-growth trading card industry, a move that complements its physical store offerings.

6. Leadership and Hiring:
Under Cohen's leadership, GameStop hired new talent, particularly in social media, product design, and mergers and acquisitions. These hires are helping to modernise the company's public image and facilitate strategic business moves.
   
7. Strengthening the Digital and E-commerce Presence:
Investments in GameStop's e-commerce infrastructure continue, ensuring that the company remains competitive in the rapidly digitalising video game and retail markets. 

Ryan Cohen's first year as CEO has set the foundation for GameStop's transformation into a more agile, diversified, and financially stable company, preparing it for sustained growth in gaming and collectibles. All of that in ONE year.

Happy Anniversary, here‚Äôs to many more. I hope you buy something nice.

She's on sale on my Vinted and OLX (link in profile). Oh boy, was I struggling with this one. That was such a hard, but fun project!

I tried to make the shoes myself this time and honestly for the first try ever I think they are good enough, it was to hard to do, I applaud everyone who is doing shoes for dolls. I also made her her fins, since she didn't have original ones and boy I won't be paying $25 for two pieces of plastic, so I made my own! They're glued to her legs tho, because I don't want them to go missing just like it is with original ones always. Also I'm so happy with all the sea shells accessories, since these are real shells my mom picked at the seashore around 15 years ago and I found them recently at my grandma's house laying in the dust, so I decided to give them new life!

I had this earphone that I had got recently. After  bit of usage, it had a very specific mark only which I know. Sometime later I couldn't find it. I thought someone stole( it's pretty common in hostel with non expensive things). After a week or so, My frnd suddenly got this earphones exactly same as mine. When I asked him if he had seen mine, he said that he borrowed it from another guy down the end of the dormitory( let's name him A). When I checked it , it had the exact same mark as mine.

Now I don't want to confront him as I got to share the space with, so I first enquired with the guy who he supposedly borrowed it from. And he said, he never owned and earphones at all. 

So, I told the A the story n asked him to play the role. When all of us frnds are sitting together, I asked A to randomly come to the place and ask for his earphones back. Now my frnd cannot say what earphones as I'm right infront. Few of my other frnds know about this too. 

I had a smirk on my face when he had to give A the earphones back n understood that he's caught red handed üòÇüòÇ.

He tried to overturn the results of the election.  He‚Äôs a traitor.

 ‚ÄúI love Donald Trump.‚Äù

You know Trump threatened Brad Raffensperger, the Republican Ga election official and tried to strong arm him into finding 11,000 votes.

‚ÄúYes I know but I love Donald Trump.‚Äù

Well did you know that Trump has been charged with election interference in Georgia? You know that right?

‚ÄúYes I know but I love Donald Trump.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think it would be a good idea as a country to put a convicted felon and a sex offender in the White House.  In fact I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea.  You know that Trump was found liable of sex abuse and the jury awarded his victim $5 million. 

‚ÄúYes I know but I love Donald Trump.‚Äù

Well you know a second jury pounded it up Trump‚Äôs ass for $83 million for defaming the victim of the sex abuse.

 ‚ÄúI love Donald Trump.‚Äù

I just think he spreads so much hatred and division in this country.

 ‚ÄúI love Donald Trump.‚Äù

Did you know he called an American POW hero a ‚Äúloser‚Äù?  Just last week he went on social media and tweeted in caps, ‚ÄúI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I know but I love Donald Trump.‚Äù

Well you know he also is proposing to behead all first born female babies when he‚Äôs elected.  You know that right? *(Sarcasm)

[https://www.op.gg/leaderboards/tier?region=kr](https://www.op.gg/leaderboards/tier?region=kr)

This guy, aptly named SINGED, appeared out of thin air last split and hit 1185 LP Challenger on the Korean server playing near exclusively Singed Bot lane.

Against all odds this 125 range Top lane champ is sweeping KR. He willingly drops massive CS leads early before wreaking havoc with insanely strong jungle gank setup, a huge level 6 power spike and god knows what else.

Singed APC is emerging as a (possibly) viable strategy all the way up to the highest ELO of KR server. So much so that it now appears on the lolalytics tier list at number 13 with a staggering 0.05% pick rate

I'm expecting a LoL Dobby video on this mad Zaunite fingers crossed. May this introduce an innovative new comer to the stale ranks of the Bot lane meta.",/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1frgo2b/a_singed_bot_lane_otp_has_hit_top_5_on_the_kr/

5973,I am literally incapable of doing a good playthrough,"Have I ever dominated the brain? No. But, somehow, across five playthroughs, I am still the worst.

Plathrough 1 - The classic blind first playthrough. Did not realise I was meant to collect other companions so only had Shadowheart &amp; Lae‚Äôzel in the party. The main quest seemed urgent and important so I ignored pretty much everything else including Lae‚Äôzel‚Äôs entire quest. I sided with the Emperor because I literally didn‚Äôt realise we had options (and he seemed nice). I didn‚Äôt think Shadowheart‚Äôs parents were that important, later I discovered she disagreed when she broke my heart. And having never met Voss, I thought Lae‚Äôzel should get her wish to ascend. Oops.¬†

Playthrough 2 - Having heard of ‚ÄòDurge‚Äô and ‚ÄòAstarion‚Äô via the internet, I decided to do a ‚ÄòRedemption Durge‚Äô run. I picked up Shadowheart and Lae‚Äôzel for old time‚Äôs sake and picked up my new vampire companion. Gale didn‚Äôt make it out the portal, a squirrel died, and I deceived everyone into believing the dead bard at camp had nothing to do with me. Look, how was I meant to know that the companions would be chill with my murdery antics? Given how well the ‚Äòjust lie to everyone‚Äôs faces‚Äô strategy had worked, when I was asked to kill Isobel, I was like, sure! Another secret murder, why not? So I killed her and lied to Jaheira. She believed me. Slayer form, check! I kept hearing about this super great scene when Durge tries to resist killing Astarion as their love interest and thinking - when is this going to happen? Turns out never, when you are the worst. Still genuinely believing I was a Redemption Durge, off we trot, time to make the Big Astarion Decision. I hadn‚Äôt spoiled too much for myself on this, and I‚Äôm not sure my little pea-brain had clocked anything as deep as ‚Äòbreaking cycles of abuse‚Äô here, so I was like ‚ÄòHmm. He won‚Äôt be able to be in the sun if he doesn‚Äôt ascend. And he loves the sun!‚Äô I really thought I was doing the right thing. (I also did not do Lae‚Äôzel or Shadowheart‚Äôs quests, once again, and was becoming increasingly confused by posts about ‚ÄòCrowns‚Äô, ‚ÄòOrpheus‚Äô and ‚ÄòRaphael‚Äô).

Playthrough 3 - OK, Tactician run time. This time, I was determined to be the GOODEST GOOD GIRL EVER. I created an Oath of Devotion Durge. I resolved not to break my oath. I wanted to experience Karlach and Wyll‚Äôs stories this time and romance Karlach, so kept them in the party and swapped my poor Shadowheart and Lae‚Äôzel in. I broke my oath like five times. But I paid that edgelord dude to fuck back off again so it doesn‚Äôt count, right? Didn‚Äôt kill Isobel this time, result. I decide Wyll should save his father, but to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention to what the consequences of that decision were to know if it was the right one? However, my darling Karlach‚Ä¶ Well, since this goody two shoes role-play was getting lowkey boring, when the opportunity came around to bang the Emperor I went for it (not my first time. I obviously did it on Playthrough 1.) My head canon was that my Durge had a secret tentacle fetish, her one flaw. OK, so fast forward, we know Karlach is doomed, someone has to become a Mindflayer, and she volunteers! This is obviously the good ending for Karlach! She gets to live! And my Durge gets her tentacle girlfriend! I honestly could not see how this was not the good ending for Karlach. Once again, the internet revealed that I was, in fact, a bad person.

Playthrough 4 - Honour run. You know the rules - don‚Äôt do things on Honour that you haven‚Äôt done before! Unfortunately for me, I have never NOT sided with the Emperor, so guess it‚Äôs another round of calamari for me. However, importantly, what I WOULD need to do differently is actually go and get Gale out the portal. This was a mistake. I fell in love with Gale. My tav fell in love with Gale. My soul fell in love with Gale. The thought even crossed my mind - maybe I should just fight the brain? But then I thought of those shiny, golden pixels and blew my favourite wizard to smithereens, earning myself my Honour Mode victory and 20 minutes of hysterical sobbing at the most brutal line in the entire game.¬†

Playthrough 5 - I fired this one up so fast so I could have an alive Gale back in my life, and it is still in progress. Ready to make my amends for the travesties of my previous playthroughs, I made a Cleric of Mystra Durge. Roughly aware that I would need to make a choice between God Gale and Human Gale but having not spoiled what those look like for myself, I thought, obviously I‚Äôll just pick the one that is best for Gale in my Cleric‚Äôs opinion. Well, turns out my Cleric is one jealous little bitch. Originally dressed in Gale-matching purple, the minute she found out about Mystra and the Orb, she defected to become a Cleric of Talos. I dyed all her clothes stormy blue - and Gale‚Äôs too, for good measure. Mystra can get fucked. God Gale is clearly the good ending here. Right? RIGHT?

So yeah. Five playthroughs, 600+ hours, and a distinct suspicion that I am the problem.¬†

EDIT: First and fourth runs were not Durge. I picked Durge for the additional plot and story immersion on the other three. You can clearly pick Durge and get ‚Äúgood‚Äù endings for every character including yourself, and the only Durge-specific ‚Äúbad‚Äù actions I mentioned in my post were in my second playthrough.

6023,AITAH For Calling The Cops On My Sister's Boyfriend And Having Him Arrested At My Daughter's Birthday Party?,"34F here. I've been married to my husband John for five years now and we have two daughters together (3F and 1F).

I'll preface this by saying that I had a tough childhood. My father was an abusive alcoholic who was violent with my mother, myself, and my two little sisters. He passed away when I was in my early twenties, and as horrible as it sounds, I was hopeful it would allow my mom and sisters to have better lives.

From the time I was young, I knew I never wanted to be in such a vulnerable situation again. I focused on my career (I'm a lawyer now) and married a sweet, dependable man who comes a kind and functional family. I want my girls to have happy childhoods and to never feel unsafe in their home.

Sadly, my youngest sister Lisa (29F) went in the opposite direction. Her only goal in life is to marry rich so she doesn't have to work and can stay home with her future kids. The issue is she chooses the worst guys. Her high school boyfriend was controlling, her next boyfriend was physically abusive, and her current boyfriend Ian topped the last one by putting her in the ER twice.

The first time Lisa ended up in the ER, she told me she was leaving Ian. I got a call from her a few weeks later telling me they had reconciled and she was back in the ER. Again, she told me she'd leave. I was hopeful, but skeptical. The prosecutor's office is brining charges against Ian, but Lisa doesn't want to testify, so they subpoenaed her. I told Lisa she could prevent him from harming someone else by being honest about what happened, but she said she felt for Ian because he had a bad childhood and wants to change. I know Ian is out on bail but can't legally have any communication with my sister, but I was worried they'd see each other anyway.

My daughter's third birthday was earlier this week. My husband and I had a birthday party for her at our home earlier today with our families, close friends, and some of her friends from preschool. I was enjoying myself, when I saw Lisa holding hands with Ian in my own backyard. I was going to confront him, but my husband told me it would escalate things. I ended up taking my girls upstairs and calling the cops. I explaining that he violated the court order and was at my home with my sister and a house full of children.

The cops came and arrested Ian, and my sister started screaming that I drive drunk with my kids all the time so they should arrest me too. To be clear, I would never do this. I told my sister to leave, and we ended the party early. I was sad for my daughter and also humiliated this happened in front of her friends, their parents, and my in-laws. I also feel immense guilt that I invited children to my home, and they were exposed to a violent predator.

My mother stayed behind after everyone left and screamed at me for calling the police. I explained I didn't know what else to do because there was a predator in my home, around a bunch of innocent children. I would have never invited Lisa if I knew she was going to bring him. My mom said that he hurt Lisa, not children, and I said that abusive boyfriends take their anger out on bystanders all the time. I told my mom I don't think I'll ever forgive Lisa for putting my children in that position, and she told me I should be trying to help my sister through a difficult time rather than turning my back on her.

My MIL ended up coming back about an hour after I left the party. She's a former prosecutor, and was upset about the situation. She said she was fearful that Ian knows where I live, especially now that I called the police on him. She said that we should stay with them if he gets out on bail until things cool down. I thanked my MIL, and told her about the conversation with my mom. She agreed with me, and said Lisa put my family and all the children at that party in a dangerous situation.

I want to be clear that I have sympathy for Lisa I and hate that she's in this position. With that being said, I can't risk my children's safety because I feel sorry for what she's going through. She put my kids in danger after I worked so hard to try and give them a happy, safe childhood. I don't know if I'll ever forgive her.

6024,Can the operator/drifter faces be improved?,"I feel like the operator faces and drifter faces are pretty bad (as has been commented on by the community aswell) but now that the faces of the 1999 characters have been shown in greater detail (and they look great, or at least way better imo), it's all the more obvious.

[Above being the comparison between them]

Yeah, sure, you can try to make the face blends ""work"" but **it's the horrific face options themselves that make it harder**

I know it may be a lot of work, but I don't really get the disparity with the player characters looking like various flavours of surface-abused blobfish, but the characters in new content looking great.

Probably a niche issue that many won't care about, but having players either choose between going into missions looking like Konzu or spending a large portion of time in face blend in a dire effort to make their character look normal, is a bit irritating.

Thoughts?

To me the Blackberry Curve was my favorite ever. It was the perfect mix of functional without overtaking your life. It was so cool to get emails in real time on your phone, have basics like GPS and a low res browser, a decent camera, good battery life, photos of your friends for the first time in the contacts screen and the ability to drop mp3‚Äôs on it for when you were on the go.

I looked in disbelief thinking, yeah but how many drops did you have, but made no comment, all 3 new golfers had been taking a few drops, I didn't mind so much, they're new. 

Cut to today and the 4 of us are playing a different 9 hole, I'm playing really well, the other guys are doing ok. We come to a par 4, I'm on the green in 3 and the other guy goes into the water, twice, ends up getting onto the green, lines up his putt and says ""this is for 4"". I couldn't help myself, I turned round and said ""4? You've got 4 shots just going in and out of that pond"" 

He says ""yeah but I don't count them like you do and it's not like we're playing for money"" 

I made a couple of other similar comments afterwards and apparently he had a right sulk in the bar afterwards. I shot a 10 over 41, he shot a 45 but I still think it was more like a 50.

6137,File your FEMA application as soon as you can,"Ashevillians - I'm so sorry for what y'all are going through. I've visited your wonderful city many times, and I just can't believe it.

I live in Houston and after having gone through two natural disasters this year (the derecho, Beryl) I wanted to share some wisdom around FEMA.

Even if you have NO damage and only lost power, file your application for help as soon as you're able - [https://www.disasterassistance.gov/](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/) - they have to wait for the disaster declaration and then update the website, but that's where you file.

If you only have/had power out, select the ""Miscellaneous"" category - which is for things like food spoilage. I got $750 (I'm single so I'm not sure if that's per person or per household) to help with things like that, though the payments took about 6 weeks after approval (but word on the street is that's because Texas wanted to be the ones to send the checks for some reason? but the website does have the option for direct deposit, so hopefully your state is a little more organized in that sense).

You'll fill out your application - even if you don't own a home and even if you have renter's insurance - and it will likely get denied at first (especially if you have renters insurance). They won't send you any kind of email notification, you have to check the website for updates.

Once it does get denied, call the help line and talk to someone. The waits can be really long unfortunately. They can usually resubmit for you which forces an actual human to review the application, where they'll probably request additional info like your insurance policy. I have renters insurance but it doesn't cover food spoilage, so I attached that and it was approved a few days later.

I don't know if any of this will be different for y'all but I wanted to at least share my experience to try and help any way I can. 

**Do NOT feel guilty about asking for help.** This is why we pay federal taxes. Just because Bob down the street has it worse than you does NOT mean you don't also deserve help. 

Good luck. Know that the rest of the country is thinking of ya'll. ",/r/asheville/comments/1frdp2o/file_your_fema_application_as_soon_as_you_can/

6173,$SHI Shina Token is getting ready to drop its utility. The SHIBB: Burning $SHIB for Charity,"Shina Token is soon to be launching  its groundbreaking staking platform: the Shina Burn Bank (SHIBB.) This technology will bring utility to Shina‚Äôs counterpart, $SHIB, by incentivizing charitable giving through burns and rewards.

The SHIBB is the crypto equivalent of a 50/50 charitable lottery. As detailed in the whitepaper, the platform consists of two components: a staking pool and a donation pool. In the staking pool, users can deposit their $SHIB or $SHI tokens, to be eligible for rewards in the form of $ETH. Staked tokens act as ‚Äúlottery tickets,‚Äù as the more tokens a user stakes, the better their odds of being rewarded. 

Designed as a ‚Äúno loss‚Äù lottery, users retain ownership of their $SHI and $SHIB tokens and may withdraw them at any time. Meanwhile, each time $ETH is deposited into the donation pool, a proportionate amount of staked tokens are burned. Half of the $ETH donations will be gifted to charity, and the other half will be randomly distributed as staking rewards.

Since distributions will be made every 7 days, users have an incentive to stake their holdings for the long term, hence providing liquidity for the SHIBB to burn tokens. Those longing to see a reduction in $SHIB‚Äôs supply, can contribute while supporting a good cause. 

Altogether, the SHIBB has massive potential to become a self-sustaining, thriving, decentralized ecosystem. When this launches, the law of supply and demand can manifest in a powerful way for $SHIB and $SHI, especially as whales decide to participate.

To sum this up in a single phrase: ‚Äústake to earn, donate to burn.‚Äù

6191,My excellent experience at Hueycoatl,"Post buff, I took a few lower level friends to Hueycoatl. I‚Äôm talking 80-90 combat. We were all hanging out IRL. They had NEVER experienced any of the mechanics before and the fight was intense. I was BGS speccing and focusing on praying to fill up the pillars to increase our DPS, they were white knuckling it to not die. We were shouting and laughing as they got hit by the attacks, combo-ed out by tail waves and the sky attacks, clinging on to life. 

In the second kill we got some pages, and they were SO hype at a collection log unique (-ish) drop from a boss. By the fifth kill, they were learning to jump over the waves. After a good hour of 3 mans, one of them said to me ‚Äúwow I get why PVM is so much fun now.‚Äù Then we went to the GE, sold our loot, and all made like 600k. Enough for the boys to invest in‚Äîfor their first time‚Äîa decent stack of ppots, super combats, and sharks because they want to keep bossing now. 

That‚Äôs who this boss is aimed at. Not people with mega-rares, not people who max efficiency every moneymaker, people who are just trying to enjoy the game.

6221,boundary-stepping grandpa gets owned,"hi all. i 22f don‚Äôt really know where else to post this, as it wasn‚Äôt intentional revenge, but certainly worked out hilariously in my favor. 

I have a grandfather who is a habitual boundary stepper, most likely having something to do with his lack of care for my parent (his child) while they were young. such entitled behaviors include waiting for my other set of grandparents to drive 6 hours (to &amp; fro. 12 total) to meet my parents in the middle to pick me up for summer time and then demanding equal time with me when he had done none of the work to get me to the state the rest of my family lives in/never planned to help drive back. one of these times, he said we were only going to dinner (always at a gross dive bar unsuited for an elementary age child. needless to say i never enjoyed my time there much) and a sleepover, but actually took off with me across the border to another country. in his mind , it was a spontaneous surprise trip ‚Ä¶ in my young mind, i was being kidnapped. my mother has always refused to throw away the cell phone she had at this time because the messages from scared young me are too gut wrenching. being grown now and knowing it was a narcissistic power play to be the favorite grandpa does not take the trauma out of the situation. 
now you have the needed backstory , well now about a year ago, his child/my parent, has passed away. i took over our home that i had been caretaker to them in since i was 12. while this has all come with some obvious challenges as literally nobody can afford to live in the US period right now, much less someone thrown into being a homeowner at the last minute. but that does not mean i need a ‚Äúnew‚Äù parent, which he seems to think i do. he‚Äôs been overbearing in a way i‚Äôve never seen that i didn‚Äôt think was possible being across country , he even rented an airbnb like six doors down from me and booked flights without warning or even asking if i would be in town!!!!! ( he already got owned for that, i ended up being in florida with the other set of grandparents anyway. luckily he told me he‚Äôd booked these things‚Ä¶ about a week prior. so at least he got partial money back and i thought learned his lesson) but then came the anniversary of the death. 
here‚Äôs the best part,
he was asking to come down to my state for the anniversary. i told him me and my other parent would be spending that day in private mourning, as we already had plans made to honor our dead. he said ‚Äúyea i figured that‚Äôs why i would come‚Äù and made me say no again. we decided on a date about a week after the anniversary date. 

he gets here and walks into the same home he was in only a few months ago when him and his wife visited. but now he was oddly walking from room to room, as if to inspect everything and what i had done with the place. the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, as i knew what he would find in the formerly computer room. he continued walking slowly from room to room, looking for something to make a passive aggressive comment on, and he finally reached the point of no return. 
there in the empty computer room it stood. silver, sky high, glistening pearly in the morning sun. 

                         My stripper pole. 


while i held my breath and waited for the comments on my newfound cardio hobby to follow soon after, i watched dumbfounded as the man tucked his tail between his legs and sat , quiet and solum on the sofa. 
i have never heard a word about it from him. ",/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1frj88y/boundarystepping_grandpa_gets_owned/

**""The exercise of U.S. power is intended to preserve not only the international capitalist system but U.S. hegemony of that system. The Pentagon's 'Defense Planning Guidance' draft (1992) urges the United States to continue to dominate the international system by 'discouraging the advanced industrialized nations from challenging out leadership or even aspiring to a larger global or regional role.' By maintaining this dominance, the Pentagon analysts assert, the United States can ensure 'a market-oriented zone of peace and prosperity that encompasses more than two-thirds of the world's economy' [italics added].**

**This global power is immensely costly. Today, the United States spends more on military arms and other forms of 'national security' than the rest of the world combined. U.S. leaders preside over a global military apparatus of a magnitude never before seen in human history. In 1993 it included almost a half-million troops stationed at over 395 major military bases and hundreds of minor installations in thirty-five foreign countries, and a fleet larger in total tonnage and firepower than all the other navies of the world combined, consisting of missile cruisers, nuclear submarines, nuclear aircraft carriers, destroyers, and spy ships that sail every ocean and make port on every continent."" - Michael Parenti, Against Empire**",/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/1frihcu/mcdonalds_empire_moment/

6258,AITAH for wanting some space from my daughter after she believed I was an abuser?,"Basically I (41M) was accused of sexually assaulting her (16F) friend (17F). She's known her just over a year so I've known her for the same amount of time. 

She tried to kiss me, I turned her down and as a result she accused me of raping her. It went on for a few weeks and even went to the police and it only came out when they were grilling her and she finally admitted it. She was assaulted but it was her mum's boyfriend and she went with accusing me because I was the ""safe"" option or some shit like that. 

When my daughter found out at the time and I was being investigated though, she cut me off. Basically didn't even want to talk to me or see me - I tried to pick her up to come over but she said she didn't even want to see me. My ex wouldn't even let me in the house (even she believed it) and her brother/my ex BIL physically assaulted me and removed me from the house because I wouldn't go until I seen my daughter. Worst thing was, she blocked me on social media but before she did she put a status on her social media just saying some bollocks like ""Believe women"". Which fucking hurt - In my daughter's eyes, I was a rapist and I assaulted her friend.

So now it's all came out and I'm cleared, she rang me up to say she wants to come over to talk but I said no - I don't think it's a good idea, it hurt me when she didn't believe me so I want to just think for a bit until I forgive her. My ex then rang saying how hurt my daughter is because I won't forgive her - she tried to apologise too and I told her I don't accept her apology either and that I don't want to talk to her either. 

They're not stopping texting me though and my daughter tried to come over and was banging my door asking to come in crying. I pretended I wasn't in. 

AITAH for wanting some space because I don't know if I can forgive her yet?

Edited to add because people keep on asking ""why were you alone with a 17 year old."" I wasn't really ""alone"" with her. They were both staying at my house, I went for a wee in the middle of the night and she was waiting outside the toilet door and scared me a bit coming out. I laughed it off and she basically lunged trying to kiss me. I laughed it off, told her no and went back to bed. I didn't really pay it any more attention and truth be told, forgot about it.

UPDATE 

I've messaged her saying basically I'm still too hurt to want to talk and I need time and space and that I'll let her know when I want to get in touch. I also said I still love her (despite not really being sure if I should say that when I am not sure if I can forgive yet).

I've also messaged my ex saying to make sure she or my daughter don't contact me again until I'm ready. Not heard anything back yet but hopefully I won't.

Someone on here (can't remember who, sorry) said I should look into a holiday which really isn't a bad idea so I'm currently looking into places I can go for a week or so and might book some time off work. ",/r/AITAH/comments/1fr6ypq/aitah_for_wanting_some_space_from_my_daughter/

6261,Being able to recognize misogyny is hurting my relationships with men I love,"In the last 6 months I have been working hard and doing a lot of introspection in order to become a better person and that includes identifying and removing misogyny from my own thinking. So I have been doing lots of reading and listening to the stories of women and the way patriarchy works, and it has changed the way I view all the men in my life. 

I constantly see vile misogyny spewing from the males in my life. Men that I love dearly and keep close to my heart, even my own uncles and father and grandfathers. Especially my grandfather. We have been close my entire life and he has been my biggest supporter through everything I've been through and I can't be more grateful for him but it's becoming deeply hurtful when I see the way he and my father talk about women. 

They talk about women poorly around me because they see me as ""one of the good ones"" for some reason because I'm not as ""emotional"" as other women (which basically boils down to me having less social needs due to my autism and not being a typical ""nagging woman"" as they call it). 

It's hurtful, and I think deep down they know it because, for example, they'll say: ""women just like to bitch about everything, they don't want to solve problems. They only want to whine and nag us about everything."" Before realizing that I'm sitting right there and then they quickly go ""but not you, you're different"". 

One of them, upon seeing a disabled/disfigured infant, commented, ""that's one of the only times where abortion should be allowed hahahahaha"" and it just broke me inside. I kept quiet bc I care about them and I don't want to ruin our relationship but it hurts so bad hearing the things they say about women around me. Like... you love me, but you think I shouldn't have autonomy over something as big as a pregnancy?

They say stuff of that nature because I'm ""chill"" about it since I've been silent about it for so long, even though it's because I've been numb to it thanks to how normalized it's been in my life until I've sought to actively unlearn it. 

Now that rhetoric like that sticks out to me like a sore thumb, it hurts and it's really damaging the way I see and interact with the men I've adored and been so close to my entire life.

6294,I think I have forever lost my husband. ,"Me 35f and my husband 35m have been together for nine years, married for five and have a two year old baby together. We were in a long distance relationship for the last two years and only started to live together again as a family since two months back. Even though it was supposed to be exciting to finally be together, i feel like I‚Äôm living through hell. My husband is completely emotionally checked out. I‚Äôm mourning the loss of the bond I had with him, I‚Äôm mourning the loss of the friend I lost. I wish I didn‚Äôt fuck up so bad. And now I‚Äôm bearing the fruits of my labour i guess, but I was struggling myself too while dealing with my life getting worse and PPD/PPA. I know that‚Äôs no excuse but how I do make my husband understand whatever I did was not purposely. I‚Äôm going through the greatest grief of my life right now and I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on my worst enemy. 

I‚Äôm in therapy and I discovered that I have an anxious attachment and I go in flight mode when triggered. I projected a lot of anxiety to my husband. I wish I knew better, I wish I communicated better, I wish I didn‚Äôt go silent when he wanted to talk, I wish I made him feel valued, I wish I could do undo all my mistakes. My therapist said it has gotten past the point of no return and to let it go, but I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what am I holding on to. He admitted that even if I give my 100% to win him back, he‚Äôs not sure what version of him I‚Äôd get. He said despite him feeling so distant from me, he wants to try. I don‚Äôt know if he meant it or not. His actions don‚Äôt align with his words. He‚Äôs too kind and I guess he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me and that‚Äôs the reason he said it. 

It‚Äôs 3am where I‚Äôm writing from and I‚Äôm laying in bed crying, that‚Äôs what I do most of the time anyways now. And my husband is out partying with friends. Which is a totally new and unusual behaviour for him but that‚Äôs what he has become now. And I hate it. I hate the fact that others have become a source of his happiness now and not me. I hate the fact the he finds solace in others company and not me. I‚Äôm jealous of his friends. I hate the fact that they get to laugh with him and not me. I hate how I‚Äôm just a nobody to him. On good days I get a hi hello even though we sleep in the same bed. We don‚Äôt talk, AT ALL. 

For all the couples out there reading this, don‚Äôt be like me. Don‚Äôt take your love, your relationship for granted, be so good to them that they think of you as the greatest blessing to them, and don‚Äôt love them the way you think love is, love them the way they feel loved.

I've been working all of my life, literally since I was in high school. I've had many, many jobs in a variety of fields in various parts of the country,  rom huge multi-national corporations to the tiniest of mom &amp; pop operations to national non-profits.

Almost none of the companies that I've worked for still exist. They were merged with other corporations and the jobs outsourced, or they went bankrupt or they were sold off by private equity.

Even the corporations that still exist no longer do so in the same numbers or the same locations.

One of my first jobs was doing data entry for the Yellow Pages, most people reading this probably don't even know what that is.

Funnily, Yoru already got partially eaten, but she got back up to prove him her worth once again. I wonder what's Fami's stance on this, considering she IS the eating personified in a way.

Maybe I'm tripping, but isn't it weird how both Makima and Yoru in the culmination of their fight with CSM have asked him something about him eating her, as if they wanted it.

I was super excited until she recently told me there would be a strict ""no plus-ones"" rule for her wedding. Here's where it gets complicated: I've been with my boyfriend (M30) for over five years, and we‚Äôve been pretty serious. The issue is that my sister has *never* liked him and has gone out of her way to exclude him from family events, make snide comments, and pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist.

I asked her why this rule had to apply to me, especially given that we‚Äôve been together for so long, and she basically said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my wedding, I can invite who I want, and I don‚Äôt want him there.‚Äù The kicker? Several of her friends who are dating *way less seriously* than us are being allowed to bring their boyfriends.

I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to attend the wedding if my partner wasn't invited, and now my family is calling me selfish for ‚Äúruining her big day.‚Äù They claim I should just suck it up and go because it‚Äôs her wedding, but I feel like it‚Äôs about more than just this one event. It feels like a pattern of disrespect toward my relationship.

So, AITA for standing my ground and refusing to attend unless she invites my partner, or am I just being dramatic?",/r/AITAH/comments/1frl5x5/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/

6480,I used chatGPT against my ex to destroy him ,"My ex recently reached out to me because he ‚Äúkinda wants to get back together‚Äù. Abuse aside, he cheated on me, came back, left again and is still in a relationship with her ‚Äúbut things are bad‚Äù.
I was down bad with him, looking back it all seems so crazy. 

But I‚Äôm smarter now.

I immediately uploaded all of our messages into ChatGPT to have some high level intelligence insights on the toxicity of our relationship. 

The AI confirmed that it was indeed toxic. 
The chat is even labeled ‚ÄúToxic relationship with ***‚Äù.

The AI identified strong narcissistic traits in him, with emotional manipulation, projection, guilt tripping and a lack of accountability. All that sprinkled with bit of vulnerability and deep feelings for me. 

On my side, you guessed it : very emotional, validating and empathic (which reinforces the manipulation), always justifying myself and trying to soothe things (which minimizes my own feelings), an obvious lack of boundaries. (I thought I knew what those are but apparently not ???) 

So. I realize that the dynamic was always in his favor, no matter how many times I ended things or blocked him (he calls in private or with other phone numbers). He always feels so comfortable to come back in my life with no shame whatsoever of what he did to me and is doing to his current partner. 

I was really feeling bad, worthless, ashamed of everything he did to me. I knew he was in the wrong and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel on the verge of ffing myself. 

I asked the AI what would be the perfect message to send to reverse the balance of power by being brutally honest about who he is while maintaining my integrity, to walk away with my head held high.

The robot destroyed his ego. 

It read him from head to toes but was still very classy about it. The pettiness. It‚Äôs like, it read in the depths of his soul, search for the insecurities in all his wrongs and threw everything right back to his face. 
Never in my life did I do that. 
I know how to read people, but this was diabolical. 

For the first time in two years, he was panicking and realized he completely lost his control over me. Sent me 10 texts in a minutes to say how much he doesn‚Äôt care. He told me ‚Äúciao‚Äù 6 times.

He tried to guilt trip me again by saying he opened up to me and ‚Äúthis is how I treat him‚Äù. My old self would have definitely fallen for that. I‚Äôd say something like ‚ÄúI understand that you‚Äôre hurt it is hard to open up bla-bla‚Äù. 

But this time, I had Dr.Robot with me. 

The AI told me the best answer was no answer but that I could also send a very short and unemotional text to signal my unwillingness to continue with this exchange.
I said ‚ÄúYou made your choice, no need to talk. Have a good night.‚Äù

He usually takes hours, even days to answer because he knows it gives me anxiety. I didn‚Äôt even close the app that he already sent 6 texts saying he doesn‚Äôt read me messages, that I always do this, it‚Äôs all my fault, he even asked me to delete our conversation. 

I left him on read and when I woke up, I saw that he blocked me. Obviously, he‚Äôs very annoyed and probably shocked that I wasn‚Äôt emotional as usual. He lost control and knows it.

I‚Äôve never felt so empowered. I finally figured it out. I learned my lesson, some people need to hear the truth about themselves without sugarcoating it and there‚Äôs no need to feel guilty about it.

EDIT : Here is the text (I had to translate it from French) 

Your hell is you. It's amazing how selfish and indecisive you can be. You're so busy protecting yourself that you don't even realize how toxic you've become to those around you. You think you can juggle other people's emotions without suffering the consequences. For one thing, that's no way to build authentic relationships. Secondly, karma has its own way of reminding us of our actions. Every time you run away, hurt, betray or humiliate, you build up an emotional debt that you'll eventually have to settle.

You've always been there, but never really present. You prefer to run away from intimacy, from vulnerability, you hide behind excuses instead of facing your own fears. It's sad, you have so much potential, and you're content to stay in your comfort zone, avoiding everything that really matters.

I'm not here to be your escape or your second option. I deserve someone who knows what they want and isn't afraid to face their own weaknesses. So while you're being a coward looking for a noncommittal relationship where you can keep playing, remember that every action has its consequences. Karma won't do you any favors.

I deserve better than this, and I'm going to thrive without you.
Take care of yourself, maybe one day you'll understand what you've lost.

EDIT 2 : He‚Äôs TERRIFIED of karma

Yesterday we unexpectedly lost our sweet girl Rain due to a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding. We are living paycheck to paycheck and had to spend the money meant for our rent and car payment both due in a few days, to get her seen and pay for cremation. I originally asked for help on cashapp and one kind person donated $50. Now my nerves have calmed more I took the time to create a gofundme. Please help if you can in anyway. I have covered vet names, addresses, and other info
for safety. Thank you.

It‚Äôs been making me think that even if I do become cis passing in the future there‚Äôs always going to be someone wondering what genitals I have 
I first experienced this kinda stuff when I was 14 and I had a group of boys at school following me around demanding I tell them what I had 
I thought it would pass as people grew older and matured but now I‚Äôm seeing a subtle similarity in my own parents and I don‚Äôt want this to be my life

I put our kid to bed and she was obviously annoyed that we came back. I sat down at the computer to do something, and there was a browser window open but minimized. I clicked on it It was a website that catered to people who were having and looking for affairs. She had a profile. There were dozens of encounters. I was absolutely reeling. I sat there staring scrolling and clicking for an hour or so. I stumbled into our bedroom and confronted her. She denied it at first, but there was too much. I didn't take it well. I didn't leave, but I moved to the guest room.

What happened over the next few months....I'm not proud of. I did everything wrong. I did everything I could to try and save my marriage. I humiliated and debased myself trying to fix things. The trickle truth lasted for months. The cheating had started as soon as I left for basic training and had lasted for the entirety of our marriage. She had my complete trust over the years, and leveraged that to avoid being caught for over 20 years.

The trickle truth came out over the following months. She had triple digit affair partners over the years. She hid it from me all that time.

She started hooking up again while I was desperately trying to fix things. She left me via a text message.

In the divorce, she just wanted cash. She had moved in with current AP and had started doing drugs. I ended up with full custody, she got all of our savings and alimony. She paid no child support.

About a year later, she moved to a different city. A few months later she wanted our kid to come visit her. I agreed and even made the drive for the hand off. When I went to pick up our child a few days later. He told me she living with someone, and was using his last name. Cohabitating was grounds for ending alimony.

I sued to end the alimony. She did show up for that hearing. She took the stand herself and said that yes she was doing everything that my complaint said she was doing, which the state said was a legal reason to end alimony, but that she didn't think it was fair to do so. It was a short trial that ended right then. I won.

But the judge admonished me. He told me he remembered our divorce and that he had considered our divorce decree to have been lopsided in my favor and had considered not granting it. He didn't want to settle this in my favor, but her testimony had left him with no choice.

It's always bothered me that the judge reprimanded me. I've always tried to live right and be fair. I feel justified, but that little nagging voice in the back of my head has always left me wondering.

Am I the asshole for suing my ex to end the alimony we agreed on after she broke the terms written in our divorce decree?",/r/AITAH/comments/1frfi3w/aitah_for_suing_my_ex_to_end_alimony/

I like to get the chicken salad supreme on an everything bagel, it's just chicken salad, bacon, and cheese with a pickle and your choice of potato salad, mac salad or coleslaw.

The other day I went to order my usual chicken salad supreme on an everything and the lady behind the counter furrows her brow and says ""what's a chicken salad supreme?"" I describe the sandwich to her, and she looks confused and says ""never heard of it"". I point to the menu behind the counter and say ""It's right there ma'am"". She rushed off all embarrassed to make the sandwich, forgot my pickle and mac salad, had to remind her, she was said ""No that doesn't come with anything"", so I point back at the sign and show her where it says ""sandwiches include a pickle and your choice of potato salad/mac salad/coleslaw"".

6716,"AITA for refusing to pay my sister‚Äôs wedding expenses after she called my child a ""mistake""?","Hi, guys, so I created a profile just for this - I have a main account I use for my art. I don't really know how to post on this sub though, so please excuse any mistakes - also I think it's important to give a TW as this had violence and death involved and I know from personal experience that it can be triggering:

So, I (F32, Deanna) am the eldest of five siblings, and I‚Äôve taken on the role of the family caretaker for as long as I can remember. I helped our parents until their passing, and, frankly, it‚Äôs exhausting. Dad died of brain cancer 3 years ago, and it was heartbreaking to watch him deteriorate over time, and Mom passed peacefully overnight after a long hard battle with breast cancer earlier this year.

FUCK cancer.

So as the oldest, I just sort of became the de-facto parent. I don't mind as I love my siblings, and its kind of my thing to ""big sister"" friends and family a lot. I'm sort of ship's counselor, and I financially help out my family. I don't mind, as I work in tech, have a side gig doing art, and inherited land and money from mom and dad- all that to say it's no real loss.

A few years ago, I adopted my cousin‚Äôs ""Charlie"" M45 child who I will just use her nickname ""Decker"" (my baby loves kickboxing) after my cousin went to prison for murdering the Decker's mother in an alcohol and drug-fueled rage - which is too long a story to add here. It was a chaotic year of mourning, paperwork and court hearings, but the adoption was finalized when the Decker was five. Now, she‚Äôs a happy, healthy 13-year-old who calls me ‚ÄúMom.‚Äù She‚Äôs in therapy, and has been since I legally could send her as she witnessed her mother's death, and I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of how resilient she is. She's my girl, my rock-star, my whole heart and I call her that - literally ""My heart"".

Fast forward to my sister‚Äôs, Clara (F30), upcoming wedding. I was thrilled for her at first, and she asked me to be MOH. I cried in joy and offered for my wife ""Honey"" (because we like The Incredible lol) F40 and I to pay for it (don't worry I asked Honey first). 

But during a bachelorette dinner I set up, she made a hurtful comment about my daughter, calling her a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù and saying I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have taken her in.‚Äù I stared at her and asked her what she meant and she said it wasn't like I was supposed to even have kids, as I am married to another woman - then said ""no hate or anything"" and laughed but then she doubled down that Decker is likely damaged and a handful.

Guys, Decker is the SWEETEST child alive. I mean she is a teen so yeah sometimes she can get challenging or rebellious here or there, but when I say she is my WHOLE heart, I mean it. She made us a family, and made our house a home. She smiles easy, cries openly and has the emotional intelligence I WISH I had myself. She always asks ""how are you doing?"" and she really means it, willing to listen to people. But she's a ""damaged"" ""mistake""!? 

 I felt like a character in a dark, twisted episode of a sci-fi show‚Äîdefending my choice to adopt felt like fighting the Borg, like I just wouldn‚Äôt assimilate. I didn't laugh it off with my sister and her friends. I just stared at her in pure disbelief. I think she knew I was hurt because she quickly changed the subject. I said I better get home, paid for everything and 3 more rounds and went home to my family. 

My sister came over the next day to yell at me for leaving and ""cutting them off"" after the 3 rounds I paid for. She said I owe her a do-over for ruining the whole weekend because I can't take a joke. Honey, who I of course told what happened, asked my sister to repeat exactly what she said about our daughter. My sister refused, and kept calling Decker ""Charlie's child"" and I just was holding back so many tears.  I told my sister that I wouldn‚Äôt be contributing a dime to her wedding expenses - that I won't stop helping her pay her rent up until she moves in with her husband, but I won't be in or pay for the wedding of a person who sees my child as a mistake. 

Honestly, I was ready to go full-on Jedi and sever that connection but Honey helped me temper myself. My sister lost it, threw the can of soda water we gave her at me, screamed ""How am I supposed to pay for this!?"" and I said, ""You have over a year, you can save up."" - so left, showving Honey out of the way in the process and blew up our sibling group chat. My other siblings are split. Some think I‚Äôm overreacting with cutting off funds for the wedding, while others agree that my sister crossed a line and needed the wake up call.

Now, I feel bad for my sister - I do love her and she is distressed by this - but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that standing up for my daughter is more important. AITA for refusing to pay for her wedding after that?

I am adding this in edit option -

I've been working on my work project at a local brewery and have been silently sobbing in reading the comments. 

Also wow so many comments! I was trying to reply to everyone but I honestly ran out of steam. I sent this post to my wife and also just bracing myself to talk to Decker tonight. We want to ask her of her aunt has done or said anything cruel to or about her. I am wishing hard that shes just confused by our questions and remain oblivious of this shitstorm. 

I love my Heart. I want her to always remain the bright, fun, loving, encouraging person she is. I don't want her to know anything about what her aunt has said.  I texted my sister if she meant this, if she really sees me, my wife, and our daughter that way or was she just drunk and stupid and doubled down in embarrassment. That said, I don't want her near Decker anytime soon. 

I feel so lost. I wasn't planning on ever being a parent and there is no fucking manual for this. What the fuck do I even do??

Wish me luck for tonight. I will need it because if Decker tells us her aunt has been cruel to her face, I will have to hold my wife back from swinging on my sister. ",/r/AITAH/comments/1frnxuo/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_sisters_wedding/

6747,I sent MAGA packing!,"I live somewhat near Del Ray, Virginia, a family-friendly, quirky, and left-leaning enclave outside of Washington, DC. Kamala Harris signs and pride flags abound. It is also where JD Vance has chosen to live.

This morning, to my surprise, there was a booth labeled ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù with a handful of Trump yard signs. The booth was staffed by a couple in their mid to late 60s. At the advice of many on this sub, I approached the couple with genuine curiosity rather than an any arguments. I pleasantly said ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and then inquired, ‚Äúwhy should I vote for Trump?‚Äù 

The woman‚Äôs first sentence was ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not Kamala Harris.‚Äù I politely steered the conversation back by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking about Kamala. I‚Äôm asking about Trump. If it were a decision between staying home and voting for Trump, why should I vote for him?‚Äù I‚Äôm sure no one will be surprised to hear they listed 10 completely non-sensical reasons that were not based in facts or reality. But for the most part, I didn‚Äôt counter them or push back. I just listened to see if there was any nugget of truth that I could discern or even empathize with. Nope. Zero. 

You could ask, why didn‚Äôt I counter their falsehoods with facts? My intention was not to debate them but to learn. I told them, truthfully, ‚ÄúI know people who voted for Trump in 2016 but by 2020, they‚Äôd come around and no longer support him. I don‚Äôt know a single person in my life who supports Trump.‚Äù The woman, who had started out defensive got angrier and angrier. She said, ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt know anyone who is voting for Kamala! We run in different circles.‚Äù Which in fact is true, but given that 95% of Del Ray supports Kamala, this was an admission that she clearly is living in her own self-constructed universe. Like, she was SURROUNDED by Kamala supporters in that very moment. The moral of the story here though, is that in keeping my cool, and apparently my innocuous questions made them so upset such that they packed up their stuff and left the Farmers‚Äô Market. I said a pleasant, ‚Äúthank you, and enjoy the shade‚Äù, and walked away. I felt victorious. üíô üåä üá∫üá∏ üó≥Ô∏è ",/r/KamalaHarris/comments/1fri1ly/i_sent_maga_packing/

6801,AITA for being upset that my boyfriend ditched our anniversary for a trip with his friends?,"I‚Äôm 27, and my boyfriend Matt is 29. We‚Äôve been together for four years, and our anniversary was last weekend. It wasn‚Äôt a big milestone or anything, but it‚Äôs still our anniversary, so I figured we‚Äôd do something nice together. We had made loose plans to go out for dinner and spend the day together, nothing fancy, just time for the two of us.

Two days before, Matt tells me his friends are planning a last-minute weekend trip to the mountains. They were going to go hiking and camping, and he asked if I‚Äôd be cool with him joining them instead of sticking to our plans. I didn‚Äôt really know how to respond at first. I was kind of shocked that he‚Äôd even consider going away with his friends on our anniversary, but I didn‚Äôt want to be the girlfriend who says no to everything, you know?

The relationship has honestly been amazing. We‚Äôve never had major issues, and he‚Äôs always been thoughtful and loving. I have no intention of leaving him over this, but I‚Äôm just taken aback and don‚Äôt know how to confront him because something like this has never happened before.

I told him I‚Äôd been looking forward to spending the day together and that it hurt that he wanted to bail on something that felt important to me. He shrugged and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a day, we can go out another time,‚Äù and that his friends had already organized everything. I tried to explain that I wasn‚Äôt asking for much, just for us to celebrate our relationship on the actual day. I thought he‚Äôd get it, but he brushed it off, saying I was being ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù and that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

In the end, he went on the trip. He left the morning of our anniversary and didn‚Äôt even check in with me. No texts, no calls. I spent the entire day feeling hurt and honestly questioning where I stand in this relationship. I tried distracting myself by hanging out with friends, but all I could think about was how he chose them over me on what‚Äôs supposed to be a special day for us.

When he got back, he acted like nothing happened. I told him how upset I was, but he doubled down, saying I was overreacting and that we could celebrate any time. He said I was making it about me and that he rarely gets to see his friends, so I should understand. I don‚Äôt want to be controlling, but I thought our anniversary would be a priority for him, even if it‚Äôs just a small celebration.

Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm in the wrong for being this upset. Maybe it‚Äôs not as big a deal as I thought, but it feels like I should matter more, right?

6857,Rest in peace my love,"Yesterday evening, I lost my baby. It was so sudden that I didn‚Äôt have time to prepare. I‚Äôve gone through so many emotions and haven‚Äôt stopped crying since. His name was Jangas, and he was only 6 years old. He was deeply loved and cared for. He always had the best, most delicious food, plenty of toys, and many places to play. He lived a good life, surrounded by people who loved him.

We lost him due to feline aortic thromboembolism (FATE). On Thursday morning, my mom was playing with him before work when, suddenly, he slipped and couldn‚Äôt move his back legs. He was scared and in pain. We live in a small city, and the vet clinic wasn‚Äôt open until 8 a.m., so he endured an hour of agony. My mom got him to the vet as soon as possible, and they explained that it was likely caused by an undiagnosed heart condition, probably present since birth. They said the thrombosis had likely been building in his body for a long time, and it was just a matter of time before it got stuck somewhere. No routine tests could have revealed this, only specific heart tests, which are only done at a clinic in another city. Jangas had regular vet visits, and his last one was just two months ago. I mentioned to the vet that sometimes he made strange breathing sounds, but the vet brushed it off, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just hair or something.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I trusted the vet. Now I wonder if we could‚Äôve done something, but could we have?

He was on medication for two days. We were supposed to take him for his third dose this morning, but he passed away yesterday due to lack of air. Thankfully, he didn‚Äôt suffer for long. He was in my mom‚Äôs and my arms, surrounded by warmth and love. I tried calling every clinic, but none were open, and no one picked up. I feel devastated. I loved him so much. He was always there. He was beautiful, and he was unique. It brings me some comfort that at least he died peacefully, in his home, with us by his side.

I‚Äôm sorry if this post is sensitive, but I wanted to share his story and offer some advice: always do the necessary tests. If you feel like something is wrong, get a second opinion. Do heart tests, especially since another vet told us that heart conditions are common in Bengal cats. It‚Äôs also important to choose the right breeders or, at the very least, have your cat thoroughly checked after bringing them home. We trusted the breeder‚Äôs documentation, but now we wonder if everything was fully disclosed. Six months after we got him, the vet told us he had feline coronavirus. I can‚Äôt remember the exact name, but they said he had it since the breeder, and it wasn‚Äôt something he caught with us.

So, please, get thorough check-ups, love your cats, and hug them tight. Take all precautions.

I know we probably couldn‚Äôt have done anything, because it was so sudden, and it could‚Äôve happened at any time. But we did everything to make sure he was comfortable, safe, and loved.",/r/cats/comments/1fraet9/rest_in_peace_my_love/

6937,"AITA for divorcing my wife after she asked for an open relationship, and now I‚Äôm thriving while she isn‚Äôt?","Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm in a bit of a situation, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm the bad guy here. I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but there‚Äôs some context that might be important.

So, my (34M) wife (32F) and I have been married for 7 years. We‚Äôve had a pretty great life together‚ÄîI‚Äôve built a successful business (I do pretty well for myself, I‚Äôll leave it at that) and we‚Äôve traveled all over the world, live in a beautiful house, the whole deal. I‚Äôve always thought we were happy.

Out of nowhere a few months ago, my wife tells me she wants to ""open up"" our marriage. Her reasoning was that we were ""missing out on experiences"" and she wanted to explore her options, but she made it clear she still loved me and didn‚Äôt want to break up. I was blindsided. We‚Äôve never had issues with intimacy or connection, and honestly, I‚Äôm in great shape, I‚Äôve always been attentive to her needs, and I just didn‚Äôt see it coming.

At first, I was against the idea, but then I figured, okay, why not see what happens? If this is what she wants, I‚Äôm not going to stop her. I agreed to give it a try, but with the condition that it goes both ways‚Äîif she‚Äôs out meeting other guys, I‚Äôm going to meet other women too.

Well, here‚Äôs where things get a little... ironic. As soon as we ‚Äúopened‚Äù the relationship, I started meeting women left and right. I‚Äôm talking crazy success on dating apps, people I meet through work, even casual flings while I‚Äôm traveling for business. Turns out, being wealthy, fit, and confident tends to attract a lot of attention. I‚Äôll spare you the details, but let‚Äôs just say I haven‚Äôt exactly been lonely.

My wife, on the other hand? Yeah... not so much. She‚Äôs been on a few dates, but nothing‚Äôs really panned out for her. A couple of the guys ghosted her, and she‚Äôs mostly frustrated that it‚Äôs not what she imagined. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm having a blast.

After a few months of this, I started to realize that I don‚Äôt need to stay in a marriage where my wife was basically looking for an excuse to cheat on me. If she wanted to be single, then let‚Äôs make it official. I filed for divorce, and now she‚Äôs upset and saying that I‚Äôm ""punishing her"" for wanting to explore herself, but honestly, I just don‚Äôt see the point in staying married if we‚Äôre both dating other people. Why play house?

So now she‚Äôs telling our friends that I‚Äôm being selfish and that I‚Äôm only divorcing her because she‚Äôs not having as much ""success"" as I am in this open thing, which is absolutely not the case. I just think we‚Äôre on different paths now, and I‚Äôve realized I don‚Äôt need to stick around when I can literally have my cake and eat it too.

AITA for filing for divorce? Or should I have tried harder to make her feel better about a situation she basically created?

  
EDIT: To clarify, I didn‚Äôt start having fun out of spite‚ÄîI genuinely went into this thinking it could work, but it just opened my eyes to the fact that we want different things. Also, the divorce isn‚Äôt about her ""failing"" at the open relationship, it‚Äôs about me realizing I don‚Äôt want this life with her anymore.",/r/AITAH/comments/1fr4qc7/aita_for_divorcing_my_wife_after_she_asked_for_an/

If this report is true, this trade makes even more sense for the Knicks wanting to do it and aiming to do it before the start of training camp.

The Knicks have reportedly wanted KAT for several years now and have inquired about his availability for years. 

They have now finally been able to acquire him, due to the Wolves financial restrictions with keeping him on the roster. 

I think the Knicks win this trade since KAT is an elite spacing big man and is a seamless first round pick for their team. 

The Wolves lose this trade because Randle is a poor fit alongside Gobert in the front court, due to their poor spacing. The spacing is poor now due to Randle‚Äôs inconsistent three point shooting and Gobert‚Äôs nonexistent spacing, since he cannot shoot beyond 5 feet of the basket. 

Donte is a nice addition for the Wolves but he is not enough to justify the monumental loss of Kat. Donte is an elite role player, but is not a genuine star, unlike KAT. 

Furthermore, KAT is a massive loss for the Wolves in their future matchups against Denver. 

It will be more difficult for the Wolves to defeat Denver now since Kat played a critical role in stifling Jokic. It is also an issue for the Wolves against Denver since they no longer have the option of deploying their three man defensive lineup of KAT alongside Naz Reid and Gobert, which was very successful against Denver in the playoffs last season. 

Overall, the Knicks have an elite starting 5 and still have decent depth off the bench to form an extremely formidable contending team in the east. Whilst the Wolves were forced to trade KAT due to future financial limitations, but have suffered a downgrade with their overall roster.

I imagine the Wolves will likely have more moves to make before or throughout the season. 

I think Randle should be expendable due to his poor fit alongside Gobert. 

It would probably have to be Randle that gets traded out of the front court pairing since it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Wolves to trade Rudy instead and receive a decent package. Even if they could get a decent return, unless it‚Äôs a sensational return that exceeds the value of the assets that the Wolves exchanged to acquire Gobert, it would be pointless to trade him, since he is a DPOY defender that anchors their teams defence.

6982,"AITAH For Telling My Cousin My Sister Is More Of A ""Man"" Than He is?","37M. Married and daddy of two (6M and 4F). 

I have a an older brother named Toby (39M) and a younger sister named Quinn (35F). I was incredibly close with Quinn growing up, and she was a sweet and sensitive little girl, and so I think I'm especially protective of her. I don't think she needs my protection though because Quinn is a total kick ass. She was a DI college swimmer and is now a successful attorney. I'm so proud of her and known she can stick up for herself, but she's still my little sister in my eyes, and I have a strong impulse to look out for her.

When Quinn was a freshman in college, she came out as a lesbian. We'd gone to Catholic school our whole lives and were raised by conservative(ish) parents who had probably never met a gay couple in their lives. It was a shock to them, but my parents love Quinn, so they've completely embraced it. They've even stopped voting in the United States because they lean conservative on most issues, but refuses to vote for candidates who don't fully support the LGBQT community because of Quinn. 

Quinn is now married to a woman she met in law school named Audrey. They actually adopted two little girls a few months ago (6F and 2F) who are sisters. I won't get into details, but they've been through a lot (their dad was abusive and neglectful), and so it's been a big adjustment for the family. The older daughter has a lot of trauma, but Quinn and Audrey are doing everything they can to love and support her. I'm honestly so proud of both of them and am enjoying watching them grow their family.

Anyways, my cousin Kaitlyn is getting married tomorrow. Quinn, Toby, my wife Riley, and Toby's wife Jamie all flew home for the wedding. Audrey stayed home with the girls because they thought the travel and wedding was too much for them right now, which we all understand. 

Now Kaitlyn is a cool person, but her family isn't my cup of tea. They're nice to Quinn to her face, but I don't think they necessarily approve of her being married to a woman. Kaitlyn's brother Patrick (36M) used to be close with Quinn, but they've grown apart over the years. Patrick never went to school, stayed in our home town, and hangs out with the same kids he did in high school who don't do much with their lives. He got his high school girlfriend pregnant when they were nineteen, and they got married, but break up and get back together constantly. Patrick, his wife, and their three boys live with my aunt and uncle because Patrick recently got fired from his job. I think he's insecure and jealous of Quinn, and he likes to blame others for why his life hasn't gone the way he imagined. 

On Friday night, the cousins and spouses all went to dinner. Quinn was telling everyone about her daughters and showing us pictures of them on her phone. Patrick (who was drunk at this point) looked annoyed kept rolling his eyes at his wife when Quinn wasn't looking. At one point, Patrick said the girls were adorable, and he's relieved she and Audrey adopted girls and not boys. Quinn asked what he meant, and he said it's important for boys to have a man in the house. Quinn seemed rattled, and the comment set me off.

I asked Patrick what a boy could learn from a ""man"" that he couldn't learn from Audrey or Quinn. Patrick started rambling about how boys loving throwing the football with their dads and how dads teach their sons to be assertive and be ""men."" He made some other dumb comments too along the same lines.

I told Patrick that based on his definition of a ""man"", Quinn is more of a man than he is. I said that she was a far better athlete than he ever was a DI swimmer and she could teach her son more about sports than he ever could as a mediocre high school baseball player. I also said that Quinn is a successful attorney in a major U.S. city, and that she probably knows more about being ""assertive"" than a grown man living at home with his parents and taking no responsibility for his life choices. 

I'll note that Quinn and my wife Riley were both laughing and exchanging looks. Everyone else was completely shocked. Toby pulled Patrick and his wife aside and completely deescalated the situation. This morning, he came into my room and told me I should apologize. He said Patrick is going through a hard time right now, and I hit below the belt. I said he was being sexist and homophonic by insinuating our little sister wasn't capable of being a good mother to a son. Patrick didn't necessarily disagree, but thinks we should be the bigger people and apologize so Kaitlyn has a great wedding. I don't want to cause drama, but also, I have no intention of apologizing. If he's going to give unsolicited opinions about my sister's ability to parent, I have no issue letting him know exactly what I think of him.

7022,"AITAH for refusing to attend my sisters ""silent wedding"" because she's forcing everyone to communicate using only ASL (none of us know it)?","I know this might sound insane but I NEED to know if I'm the crazy one here. My (34M) sister (31F) is getting married in two months and she's decided to have a ""silent wedding‚Äù which means no one is allowed to speak during the ENTIRE wedding. Instead she expects all 200+ guests to communicate using American Sign Language the entire day but literally NO ONE in the family knows ASL.

Now, my sister is NOT deaf nor is her fianc√© nor are any of the immediate family members. She just thought it would be ""unique"" and ""intimate"" to force us all to learn a completely new language for her wedding. Her exact words: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more inclusive for the deaf community‚Äù (Reminder: NO ONE IN THE WEDDING PARTY IS DEAF)

I told her this is absolutely absurd and that she can't expect hundreds of people to learn a new language just for one day of her life. She got furious and said I‚Äôm ‚Äúruining her vision‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing ableist‚Äù by refusing to participate. I told her this isn‚Äôt about ableism, it‚Äôs about the fact that none of us can communicate in ASL and that her wedding will basically just be 200 people sitting around silently confused as hell.

She says we have ""plenty of time to learn the basics"" but I'm a busy adult with a full time job, a family, and... idk, hobbies that don't involve learning an entire new language for someone else‚Äôs Instagram clout?? When I told her I might not even come if she doesn‚Äôt ease up on the ASL only rule she said I'm being selfish and not supportive of her ‚Äúgroundbreaking idea‚Äù

My parents are on her side of course because they think it's ""cute and creative"" and they‚Äôve already started practicing the alphabet (as if that‚Äôs going to be enough).

7032,Harris Rips Trump as 'One of the Biggest Losers of Manufacturing in American History',"Excerpt:

""Donald Trump is one of the biggest losers of manufacturing in American history,"" Harris, who outlined her own domestic manufacturing priorities earlier this week, said in a statement Thursday. ""He makes empty promise after empty promise to American workers, but never delivers. As president, he cut taxes for corporations, encouraged outsourcing, and lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs, including auto jobs. He has joked about firing workers, supported state anti-union laws, and suggested companies move jobs out of Michigan.""

He was an absolute ironman early on, missing 5 games total in his first 4 seasons, but since then has averaged just 50 games a year. 

Health concerns are constantly brought up for the other 3 players but I haven't heard it discussed at all regarding KAT. The 5 year mark isn't particularly cherry picked either - KAT has played the fewest games of that group the last 2 years, and is tied for 2nd fewest games the last 3 and 4 years.
